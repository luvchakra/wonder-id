 * route-group `page.tsx` files.
 *
 * Positioning (2026-10-01, user request): IGA for human and non-human
 * identities, with every shipped feature and the security, privacy and
 * compliance controls built into the product. Every claim on this page maps
 * to something that exists in the product; control mappings are described
 * as evidence for auditors, never as a certification (CLAUDE.md §10 item 10).
 *
 * Built entirely from the locked design system's tokens and `modules/ui`
 * primitives — no second styling approach, no gradient/neon/glassmorphism
 * (docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md §5). The "machine" character comes
 * from precision instead of effects: a hairline grid, monospace for
 * machine-readable values, hairline borders, layered surfaces and small
 * status indicators. §11's SHOULD/CAN/DID model is the centrepiece,
 * rendered with the same vocabulary the product itself uses.
