/**
 * Non-negotiable #20: no direct connection between WonderID and an
 * organization's data; every flow goes through the connector framework.
 * This test keeps it true as the code grows, by scanning the source:
 *
 * - Outbound: only the framework (and its SSRF-guarded fetch) calls an
 *   organization's systems. The few other server-side callers reach
 *   WonderID's own providers (AI model, email), never organization data.
 *   Browser code only calls WonderID's own API.
 * - Inbound: a route that runs without a user session is a machine
 *   endpoint, and the only machine endpoints that may receive an
 *   organization's data are the framework's receivers (/api/connect/).
 *
 * Adding to an allowlist below is a change to the architecture: it needs
 * the user's approval and a line in docs/integrations/CONNECTOR-FRAMEWORK.md.
