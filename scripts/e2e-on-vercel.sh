# The nightly Playwright suite, run inside a Vercel build of the
# `e2e/nightly` branch (scripts/vercel-build.sh).
#
# Why on Vercel: the suite needs the project's Supabase service role key,
# encryption key and cron secret. They are Sensitive variables in Vercel,
# which never leave Vercel, so the suite runs where they are already
# provided (user decision 2026-10-10). Nothing is copied to GitHub.
#
# Steps: install Chromium's system libraries (Amazon Linux 2023, dnf) and
# Playwright's headless Chromium, build the app, start it on
# localhost:3100 (private-network stubs allowed, as in playwright.config.ts's
# webServer; this process only, never the deployed app), run the suite, and
# fail the build if anything failed.
#
# Specs: the commit message may carry one line `specs: <files>` (from the
# workflow's manual run); only paths under tests/e2e/ ending in .spec.ts are
# accepted, anything else is ignored.

# four, so each part keeps a margin as the suite grows). A run of chosen specs uses e2e/nightly and is not
