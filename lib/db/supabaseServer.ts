 * caller in it — the layout, the page, each module service they call —
 * shares it. The client itself is cheap to construct; what matters is that
 * its auth state (the verified session, a refreshed token) is resolved once

 * bundled into client code; `getSupabaseServiceRoleKey()` adds a second,
 * independent runtime guard.

 * when one is signed in, so the database's record_provenance trigger
 * (migration 0115) can record who created or changed a row even though
 * the connection itself carries no session.
