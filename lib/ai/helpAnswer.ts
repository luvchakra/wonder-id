 * The user-guide assistant behind `/help`.

 * Retrieval is deterministic and runs first: the question is scored against
 * the guide sections in `modules/ui/help/content.ts`, and those matches —
 * not the model — are what produce the links shown to the user. An LLM, when
 * one is configured, only phrases an answer grounded in the sections that
 * retrieval already chose.
 *
 * Two properties fall out of that ordering, both deliberate:
 * - The assistant cannot invent a link or cite a page that does not exist,
 *   because it never chooses links at all.
 * - It still works with no AI provider configured, returning the matching
 *   sections and their summaries. AI improves the phrasing; it is not load
 *   bearing (same posture as every other AI feature here — advisory only,
 *   never a decision, non-negotiable #9).
