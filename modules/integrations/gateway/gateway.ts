/**
 * The Connector Gateway: the one place every connection's traffic passes
 * between WonderID and an organization's systems (non-negotiable #20; user
 * requirement 2026-10-10, "all such connections should pass through one
 * gateway which sits between WonderID and external world").
 *
 * - Outbound: the http, mcp, ldap, sql and powershell drivers are built only here, each
 *   wrapped so that every request first passes the connection's policies:
 *   the connection is not disabled, the per-run request budget is not
 *   spent, and the definition's rate limit (rateLimitPerSecond, a token
 *   bucket) is honoured. HTTP and MCP then go through guardedFetch (SSRF
 *   guard, timeout, response size cap); LDAP and PostgreSQL connect only
 *   to an address resolveSafeHost vetted.
 * - Inbound: the /api/connect receivers record each request here
 *   (receive.ts), so both directions land in the same ledger.
 * - Accounting: every request is counted in memory per session and written
 *   once, on flush(), into connector_traffic (migration 0110), by host name
 *   only. Never a path, query, header, body or credential.
 *
 * A session is one run: a sync, a connection test, an MCP discovery, a
 * preview, or one received request. Open it, hand `drivers` to the
 * connector (createDefinitionConnector), and flush() in a finally.
