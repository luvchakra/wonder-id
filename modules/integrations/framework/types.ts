/**
 * The connector framework's definition format (schema version 1).
 *
 * A connector definition is data, not code: it says how to reach one
 * product (its settings, how to authenticate, which requests return which
 * records) and how each record maps onto WonderID's canonical objects.
 * One engine (engine.ts) runs every definition through a protocol driver,
 * so a new product needs a definition, never a new adapter class.
 *
 * WonderID ships built-in definitions (definitions/*); a system integrator
 * writes their own as JSON and stores it for their organization
 * (connector_definitions, migration 0108). Both go through validate.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately not a scripting language: mappings are field paths, string
 * templates and a closed list of transforms (`TRANSFORMS`). Anything that
 * would need code belongs in a driver, which WonderID owns and reviews.
