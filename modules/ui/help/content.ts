/**
 * The WonderID user guide, as structured data rather than prose pages.
 *
 * Structured because two surfaces read it: `/help` renders it, and the help
 * assistant (`lib/ai/helpAnswer.ts`) retrieves against it. Keeping one
 * source means an answer can never cite a section that does not exist —
 * the assistant picks from these entries and links their anchors, rather
 * than inventing a link.
 *
 * Content rule: describe only what is actually built, in the UI's own words
 * (menu paths as the sidebar shows them, exact button labels). Never describe
 * a planned feature as available. A change that adds, removes or renames a
 * user-facing feature updates the section here in the same pull request and
 * sets its `updated` date (CLAUDE.md §19.7); `links.test.ts` fails when a
 * section links to a page or section that no longer exists.

    summary:
      "No — consequential changes require a human to initiate them, and a read-only connector cannot write at all.",
    body: [
      "WonderID recommends remediation, but a person initiates consequential grants, revocations, policy overrides and destructive actions, for example Request remediation on a finding, Revoke on a grant, a Revoke decision in an access review or Remove access on a rogue account, each after a confirmation.",
      "Two things follow from a person's decision or an administrator's setup: a connection that may make changes sets up or removes approved access, and a leaver's access becomes removal work. A request policy can also approve low-risk requests automatically, below a threshold an administrator chooses; high-risk access always needs a person.",
      "This is deliberate. An autonomous system that silently revokes production access is a bigger risk than the one it is trying to manage.",
