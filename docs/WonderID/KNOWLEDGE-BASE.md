A plain-language guide to what WonderID does, how its parts fit together and where to find each feature. It is kept current as the product changes.

---

## 1. What WonderID is

WonderID is an identity governance and security platform. For every identity in your organization, it answers:

- **Who or what is it?** A person, a contractor, a service account, a machine, an application or an AI agent.
- **What can it access?**
- **Why does it have that access?** Who approved it, and under which rule.
- **Is that access still right?**

The everyday cycle looks like this:

```text
 Connect a system ─▶ Import accounts and access ─▶ Check each piece of access
        ▲                                                     │
        │                                                     ▼
 Verify by reading ◀─ Make the change ◀─ Approve ◀─ Request (or flag what's wrong)
 the system again     (person or connector)
```

**Two principles hold everywhere:**
- **Nothing counts until it is verified.** A change counts as done only after WonderID reads the system again and sees it.
- **People decide.** Access changes are approved by people. A request policy can approve low- and medium-risk requests automatically, recorded as such; high-risk access always needs a person. Automation credentials and AI never approve.

**What WonderID is not:**
- It is not your sign-in provider, HR system, password vault or security monitoring tool.
- It works alongside those systems and keeps a record of where each piece of information came from.

## 2. Signing in and getting around

**Signing in**
- **Ways to sign in:** email and password, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, or your organization's single sign-on (SSO).
- **Two-step verification:** add an authenticator app in Settings → Security. An administrator can require it for everyone (Global Configuration → Sign-in and sessions); turning it on needs a session that has itself used it.
- **Forgotten password:** use "Forgot password" on the sign-in page.
- **Methods not set up:** a sign-in method your organization hasn't set up shows as unavailable.

**Organizations**
- Each organization's data is completely separate from every other organization's.
- You may belong to more than one organization.
- Each organization can have its own web address and logo.

**Navigation**
- **Main menu:**
  - Home: the dashboard, a summary of the whole platform;
  - My Workspace: my requests, approvals waiting on me, my tasks, my privacy, sign-in security;
  - Access: request access, all requests, provisioning, packages;
  - AI Agents;
  - Access Reviews;
  - Risk & Detection: rogue accounts, rogue agents, SoD violations, investigations;
  - Self Service: register an agent.
- **Administration menu:** organization administration has its own sidebar. Open it with **Administration** at the bottom of the main menu, and use the back button to return. It holds:
  - Identities;
  - Applications (including onboarding an application and the entitlement list);
  - Policies & Controls (including request policies);
  - Reports & Audit;
  - Users & Roles;
  - Integrations;
  - Organization Settings;
  - Privacy & Audit.
- **What you see:** each menu lists only the pages your permissions allow.

**Everywhere**
- **Search:** global search finds identities, agents, applications, findings, requests and more.
- **Creating something from a list:** open the list's **Actions** menu at the top right and choose the first item (for example "Create policy…", "New group…" or "Add data source…"). The form opens in a window over the list. It is only there if you are allowed to create that kind of record.
- **Notifications:** in the app, and by email if you choose.
- **On phones and tablets:** WonderID can be installed like an app, and every screen works at phone size. Install it once from the main address (account menu › Install the app, or id.wonderapps.biz/install): the one app opens every organization and environment you belong to, and switching between them stays in the app. This works in Chrome and Edge on a computer. On phones (Android and iPhone) and in Firefox a switch opens the other address in the browser's overlay, with its own sign-in (owner decision, 14 Oct: keep it that way). An organization's own address no longer installs a separate app. Each address keeps its own sign-in, so the first visit to an organization in the app asks you to sign in there.
- **Light and dark mode:** both are supported.
- **Help centre:** for signed-in people only (since 16 Oct 2026). It has a user guide, an FAQ and an assistant (WonderID AI in the account menu) that answers questions from the guide. Signed out, you go to sign-in and come back to the help page you asked for; the sign-in screens offer "Need help? Email us" instead. Each guide section shows when it was last updated.

## 3. Identities

**One directory for every identity:** people (employees and contractors), external users, service accounts, machines, workloads, applications, APIs and AI agents.
- **Where:** Admin → Identity Repository → Identities.

**Owners**
- Every non-human identity, such as a service account or an AI agent, has a responsible person.
- **Unowned identities:** a service account found in a connected system that belongs to no one waits in **Onboarding → Unowned Identities** until someone assigns an owner.
- **No owner, no requests:** nobody can request access for an identity without an owner.

**Joiners, movers and leavers**
- When someone joins, changes role or leaves, WonderID creates the work that follows: tasks to hand over ownership and remove access. People do this work.
- When someone joins (on their start date), is rehired or moves, they get the birthright packages they are eligible for at once (see Access packages).
- When someone actually stops working (disabled, terminated or archived), each access they hold gets its own removal task on Fulfilment Tasks, marked "Person left" and due within a day. Access approved but never set up is withdrawn. Serving notice does not start this.
- A person makes each of these removals, even where a connection could; it counts as removed only when a later read of the system no longer finds it.
- Where a connection can disable accounts and has changes turned on, it disables the person's account there at once. The next read confirms it. If it fails, the application's owner gets the task with the reason.
- When a person leaves, what they owned is transferred to someone else, never left without an owner.
- Identity rules (Identities › Rules) can also run on these moments: when a person becomes active, moves, gets a new manager, leaves, or reaches their end date. Such a rule sets one of the person's details, or opens a task about the person for their manager or for identity administrators (for example "Order a badge"). A rule opens one task at a time per person; the task appears with the other lifecycle tasks. A rule can also add the person to a group or assign them an access package. Each such rule says whether a person approves every grant (an approval task with the other lifecycle tasks: Approve gives the access, Reject needs a reason, and nobody approves their own) or whether it applies automatically, which is allowed because every rule is published by a second administrator.

**Identity sources**
- An HR system or directory can be the source of people's details.
- **Matching:** a record keeps the identity the source already linked it to. Otherwise the source's rules are tried in order (email by default; username or a combination of fields can be added). One match links automatically; several, or a single match on someone who has left, wait in **Pending Matches** for a person to decide. A wrong match can be undone on the person's page (**Source records → Unlink**): the details that record changed go back to what they were, unless someone changed them since, and the record is never matched to that person again without a person deciding.
- **Which source wins:** you choose which source owns which detail, and each source's priority. When a lower-priority source sends a different value for a detail a higher one owns, the higher value stays; the disagreement is listed under **Pending Matches → Disagreements between sources**, with both values and both sources. It clears itself when the sources agree again.
- **Custom details:** your own fields, such as cost centre, can be filled from a source. Each value is checked and WonderID records which source set it.

**Duplicates**
- Possible duplicate AI agents are flagged for review and merged only after a person agrees. A merge cannot be undone.
- **Two records of the same person** can be merged. When another record has the same email or name, the person's page says "Possible duplicate"; **Compare and merge** shows both records side by side, and you choose which value stays wherever they differ.
  - The merge moves the other record's accounts and access, access packages, pending requests, open findings, direct reports, source records and WonderID sign-in to the record you keep. The other record becomes inactive and shows which record it went into.
  - History stays with the record it happened to.
  - **Undo the merge**, on either record, puts everything back; it needs a reason.
  - Two records that both sign in, hold the same package, have the same pending request or come from the same identity source can't be merged.
  - Nobody can merge their own record; another administrator must do it. Two records that share no email and no name can be merged only with a stated reason.

## 4. AI agents

AI agents are governed like any other identity. They also get controls designed for software that acts on its own.

**Approved purpose, actual access and observed behaviour**

For every agent, WonderID compares three things:
- **Approved (SHOULD):** what the agent is approved to do, from its contract: purpose, owner, approved applications, data and actions.
- **Effective access (CAN):** what it is technically able to do, worked out from its real permissions.
- **Observed (DID):** what it has actually done, from its runtime activity.

A gap between them, such as access the agent shouldn't have or something it did that wasn't approved, becomes a finding.

**Agent 360**
- One page per agent: its contract, owner, lifecycle state, access, activity, risk and findings.

**Discovery and shadow AI**
- WonderID finds agents and AI tools that were never registered.
- You review what it found and register it, or dismiss it.

**The Runtime Gateway**
- **What it is:** agents can ask the gateway before taking an action. Only actions sent to the gateway are checked; an agent that calls a system directly is not checked or stopped.
- **Bypass detection:** once an agent uses the gateway, any action WonderID sees from another source (MCP, a runtime or a webhook) without a gateway decision for it shortly before becomes a "gateway bypass" finding. So does an action that went ahead although the gateway said no. This finds a bypass after the fact; it does not stop it. Agents that never use the gateway are not judged.
- **Gateway only:** on an agent's page (API keys → "Gateway only"), someone with emergency-control permission can turn this on. Then a bypass by that agent is a critical finding, and the agent is suspended at the gateway at once: every call is refused, in every mode, until an administrator lifts the suspension on the Runtime page.
- **Two modes:**
  - *Observe* (the default): the decision is recorded and the agent is told to go ahead, except when an emergency control applies or no decision can be worked out: then it is told no.
  - *Enforce:* the agent is told to allow or block the action, against its contract and access. A platform administrator switches it on for an organization. If no decision can be worked out, the answer is block.
- **Emergency controls:** an organization-wide stop, or blocking a tool, an MCP server or a session. They block at once, in both modes. To stop one agent, suspend it.
- **API keys:** each agent can have its own API key for the gateway.

**Inventories**
- MCP servers, their tools (classified as read or write) and resources.
- The data sources agents can reach.
- Non-human identities and their credentials (for ownership, rotation and expiry; WonderID never stores the secret itself).

---

## 5. Connecting your systems

All information from your systems reaches WonderID through **connections**. There is no other path in or out.

**Connection types and connections**
- **Connection type:** describes one product's interface, for example Keycloak, an LDAP directory or Kubernetes.
- **Connection:** your organization's link to that product, with its address, its credentials (stored encrypted, shown masked) and a sync schedule.
- **Where:** Admin → Integrations.

**Built-in connection types**

| Kind of system | Built-in types |
|---|---|
| HR | Frappe HR |
| Directories and identity providers | LDAP directory (which can also add and remove group members), Keycloak, Saviynt, and any identity provider or HR system that pushes people over SCIM 2.0 |
| Applications | ERPNext, Gitea, Mattermost, Nextcloud, Zendesk, and any application with a SCIM 2.0 service (which can also add and remove group members, disable and create users) |
| Infrastructure and data | PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, OpenBao (secrets) |
| AI | MCP server, Runtime Gateway |
| Anything else | Webhook (signed events from any system), CSV files |

**Your own connection types**
- An integrator can describe any system with an HTTP, LDAP, SQL, MCP or file interface: no code, just a definition.
- **Checked as you type:** the editor checks the definition and can try it against the real system before saving.
- **Form or JSON:** write it in a guided form (basics, settings, sign-in, one kind of record at a time) or as JSON; both edit the same definition. After "Try it", field paths can be picked from the sample response.
- **Sharing and upgrading:** download a connection type as a file and open it in another organization's editor. When a newer version is published, a connection shows "available"; its preview lists what changes (settings, sign-in, what it reads and how fields are mapped) before you upgrade. An upgrade never allows more changes in the system than before, and the next sync reads everything again.
- **Cleaning up values:** values can be changed into the form WonderID needs. For example: make text lowercase, look values up in a table, pick out part of a value with a pattern, replace text, fall back to another field, or shift a date.
- **Sign-in styles for the system:** none, basic, bearer token, API key (in a header, the address or the request body), OAuth client credentials, LDAP bind and database user.
  - **With a private key instead of a shared secret:** for OAuth, the connection signs a short-lived token with your organization's private key (the style service accounts use). The key is stored encrypted and never shown or logged.
  - **With a client certificate:** for systems that require one (mutual TLS). The certificate is only ever presented to that connection's own secure address.
  - **Sign in with the provider:** an administrator presses **Connect** on the connection's page and approves on the system's own sign-in page. WonderID keeps the resulting sign-in encrypted and renews it by itself. If the sign-in is revoked, the connection asks to be connected again.

**Syncing**
- **Schedule:** each connection syncs on a schedule, or on demand with "Sync now".
- **What happens after a sync:** WonderID updates identities, then accounts, then access, without anyone pressing a button. Each step shows its progress and counts on the connection's page.
- **Faster scheduled syncs:** a connection type can say how to ask for **only what changed** since the last good sync. Scheduled syncs then read just the changes. If no full read has succeeded in the last day, the next scheduled sync reads in full. Records are marked missing only when every record of that kind was read.
- **Cut-short runs:** a sync whose read stopped at a limit counts as partial and says why. It never moves the starting point of the next read of only the changes, and never counts as the day's full read.
- **Counted reads:** when a system says how many records it holds (SCIM always does; other connection types can declare where), a read that brings back fewer counts as partial too, and nothing is marked missing.

**Noticing removals**
- When something disappears from a system, such as an account deleted or a person who left, a full sync marks it "missing at the source". Nothing is deleted, so the history stays.
- **Mass-missing guard:** if a sync would suddenly mark a large share as missing, it is held until a person approves or discards it. A broken file can't wipe out your data.
  - Most kinds are held above 20% of a kind with 20 or more records, by default.
  - People are held above 10%, or the organization's setting if it is lower.
  - Any kind, at any size, is held when every record of it would go missing at once.

**People pushed to WonderID over SCIM**
- An identity provider or HR system that provisions users over SCIM 2.0 (for example Okta or Microsoft Entra ID) can send its people to WonderID as they join, change and leave.
- **Setting it up:**
  1. Create a connection of the type "SCIM 2.0 provisioning (incoming)" and issue its secret.
  2. Enter the connection's SCIM address and secret in the system's provisioning settings.
  3. Add an identity source that reads the connection.
- **What happens:** each user the system creates, changes, deactivates or deletes is kept on the connection first. The identity source then takes it in, with its own mappings, matching and the fields it owns.
  - For the person's id, map `normalized.externalId`: that is the id WonderID gave the user. The system's own id stays in the record as `externalId`.
- **Leavers:** a deleted user is marked missing, never erased, and the source treats them as a leaver, under its leaver guard.
- **Groups:** groups pushed over SCIM are not received yet.

**Files**
- Every list in WonderID has **Import** and **Export**.
- **Import:** CSV files are previewed first, then new records are added and existing ones updated.
- **Bulk invitations:** Users → Import CSV.

**The Connector Gateway**
- Every call to or from your systems passes through one gateway.
- It blocks calls to internal or unexpected addresses, for every organization, and limits the request rate. A connection's credentials are not sent when a system redirects elsewhere.
- **Allowed hosts (optional):** an administrator with the security permission can list the hosts connections may reach (Administration → Global Configuration → Connections). Anything else is refused, including redirects. Empty means any public host.
- It also counts usage.

---

## 6. Applications, accounts and access

**Application catalog**
- Every governed system has an owner, a risk level and a data classification.
- **Application discovery:** applications found in connected systems but not yet in the catalog are listed for review.

**Onboarding an application**
1. **Configure:** choose its connection and how its accounts match identities, and optionally an **account name format** for the accounts that approved requests create, such as `{firstName:lower}.{lastName:lower}` (placeholders: first name, last name, email, the email's name, username). Without one, a new account is named by the person's username or the name part of their email; an AI agent's by its name. If the name is taken in the application, -2, -3 is added.
2. **Validate:** WonderID checks the configuration.
3. **Simulate:** see what it would import before anything changes.
4. **Approve:** a second person approves.
5. **Promote:** the configuration goes live.

An AI assistant can **propose** an onboarding configuration; a person always reviews and approves it.

**Onboarding templates:** an administrator can keep a template per connection type, with a questionnaire, so applications of that kind are onboarded the same way (Admin → Applications → Onboarding Templates).

**An application's page** has tabs: Details, Entitlements, Onboarding, Accounts and, for administrators, Settings (edit and lifecycle). The Entitlements tab lists the application's entitlements and its entitlement types as tables. Each entitlement has a display name, description, type, privilege, risk, data classification, whether it can be requested or reviewed, SOX relevance and a status; each type has a display name, description, how it is requested, its durations and whether it is reviewed. Administrators add either from the card's header (an entitlement always under one of the types) and edit, disable or delete one from its row's menu. Something in use is disabled rather than deleted: an entitlement from a connector or one ever granted, and a type entitlements still have. A disabled entitlement can't be requested, and a disabled type takes no new entitlements. Someone other than the submitter approves an onboarding; an organization administrator may approve their own, with a note, recorded as self-approved. The Onboarding tab shows the whole onboarding (configure, validate, simulate, approve, promote); onboarding's "Entitlement model discovered" step passes once there is at least one entitlement.

**Entitlement types and classification rules:** each application can name its kinds of entitlement (role, group, permission set) with their own request rules and durations. Classification rules set an entitlement's privilege level, data classification, type, whether it is requestable and whether it is SOX-relevant, from what is known about it and its application, when it is imported or changes. They never override a value a person set; a rule is simulated first and published by a second person (Admin → Organization Settings → Classification Rules).

**Accounts**
- Each account is matched to its identity.
- **Once matched, an account stays with its person.** If a later sync would match it to someone else (for example, an email address given to a new person), the account keeps its person. The connection's sync results count it as "kept with their person"; relink it by hand if it really changed hands.
- **Unlinking an account** sends it back for matching at the next sync, never back to the same person unless someone links it by hand. Undoing a wrong source match (see Identity sources) also re-matches that person's automatically matched accounts.
- Accounts are flagged when:
  - they match no one (*orphan*);
  - they match more than one identity (*ambiguous*);
  - they haven't been used for a set time (*dormant*).

**Entitlements and access**
- Each system's permissions (groups, roles) and who holds them are imported.
- You can preview the changes, then apply exactly what you saw.

**Every piece of access is labelled:**

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Approved** | WonderID has the request or decision behind it |
| **Legacy** | It was already there when the application was first connected |
| **Unproven** | No WonderID approval found, and it can't yet be called legacy or rogue (no baseline yet, or not reported by a connection) |
| **Rogue** | It appeared later with no approval; this raises a finding |

**The access ledger**
- Answers "why does this identity have this access?": where it came from, who approved it and when.
- Each access also shows when the system last confirmed it.
- Every record shows where its information came from.

---

## 7. Requesting access

**The request catalog**
- Ask for access to an application or a specific permission, with a reason.
- You can also ask to **remove access**, **create an account** or **disable an account**.
- **Request numbers:** every request gets a number to quote, REQ and nine digits (for example REQ000000042), counted per organization. When you submit, the number appears with its barcode; it is also on the request's page and in the requests list.

**Who you can request for**
- **Yourself:** yes.
- **People you manage:** yes.
- **A service account you own:** yes.
- **An AI agent you are the business owner of:** yes, but only what its approved contract allows; anything else is refused.
- **Someone who handed you their requests:** while their delegation is in force, you can ask "on behalf of" them, with their request rights (never an access manager's). Both of you are recorded, and neither of you can approve it.

**Several at once**
- **Basket:** ask for several pieces of access, for one or more people, in one go (Request access → Several at once). Each line is its own request.
- **Model after:** ask for the same access a colleague has.
- **Drafts:** save a basket and finish it later.

**Request policies and approvals**
- Each application or permission can have its own policy, covering:
  - who approves, in which order;
  - whether low-risk requests are approved automatically;
  - how long access may last;
  - whether a reason is required.
- Nobody can approve a request they made, or one that is for them.
- **Setting a policy:** choose the scope (the organization default or an application) and its current policy opens. The form has three parts: who can request; approval (Approved by is one of your approval workflows or a built-in route: manager, owner, manager then owner, or both at once); and how long access lasts. The workflow's page links back to each policy that uses it.
- **Approval workflows:** an approval pattern defined once and used by the policies of as many applications as follow it (Administration → Integrations → Approval Workflows → Actions → New workflow…).
  - A workflow has up to six levels, run in order. Each level names up to five approvers: the manager, the manager's manager, the owner of what is requested, the application owner, a named person, a group (any one member approves) or access managers.
  - A level is decided by all its approvers, or by any one of them; once one approves, the others are no longer asked.
  - A level can apply only from a risk upwards, for example a security review for high and critical risk.
  - A rejection at any level rejects the request. Someone who approved an earlier level can't approve a group's level as well.
  - For a service account or an AI agent, the owner of what is requested approves where a level asks for a manager.
  - A change applies to new requests at once, as the workflow's next version; requests already waiting keep their approvers. A workflow a policy uses can't be retired.
- **Changing a policy:** in an organization with two or more Tenant Administrators, a change to a request policy waits, showing each field's old and new value, until someone else who manages access approves it (Request policies → Waiting for approval). Approved, it applies as the policy's next version; rejected, nothing changes. With one administrator a change applies at once. Every applied change is kept as a numbered version.
- Approvers get a message with a link straight to the request when it reaches them.
- **The requests list:** each line starts with its request number and the date, and the number opens the request. A waiting request says whom it is waiting on: the person by name, any member of a group, or an access manager.
- **My requests** lists the requests you raised and those someone raised for you (marked "For you").
- **Away?** Hand your approvals or your requests to a colleague until a date (Approvals → Delegate your approvals). They act on your behalf, every decision records both of you, and either of you (or an access manager) can end it.
- **An AI agent acting for you:** let an agent act for you (or for an agent you own) for named actions, optionally named applications, for up to 180 days. It takes effect once an owner of the agent approves it; nobody approves their own. When an agent tells the Runtime Gateway it acts for someone, the request is held for approval unless an approved delegation from them covers that action.
- **Administration:** someone who manages roles can also hand a person's administration to a colleague. The colleague gets copies of that person's roles until the end date; ending it early removes them at once. The Tenant Administrator role is never handed over, and roles the colleague already holds are left as they are.
- A request policy can approve low- and medium-risk requests automatically; these are recorded as approved automatically. High-risk requests always wait for a person.
- Separation-of-duties rules can block a request that would give a conflicting combination of access.

**Access packages**
- Bundles of access that are commonly needed together, requested in one go.
- **Business and IT roles** are kinds of access package: they are requested, approved, assigned, reviewed and ended the same way.
  - A role (or package) can include other active roles and packages. Assigning it grants its own contents and theirs; the role's page shows which role each item comes from. A role can't include itself, directly or through another role.
  - **Simulate adding or removing** (on the role's page, for access managers) shows what it would grant or take away for one identity, from their recorded access, the highest risk involved, and any access it would combine that must not be combined. Nothing is changed.
- **Birthright:** a package can be given automatically to the people it is for (by type and department) when they join, are rehired or move. They get it without a request; it is set up and verified like any other access.
  - Two administrators turn birthright on: one asks, someone else approves.
  - Any change to what the package includes, or to who it is for, needs approval again; until then nobody new gets it.
  - One administrator can turn it off.

**Time-bound access**
- Access can have an end date.
- You are reminded before it ends and can ask to extend it.
- At the end date the access is no longer approved. WonderID opens a task to remove it, due within a day, and counts it as removed only when a later read of the system no longer finds it.
- The request shows where that stands: "Ended · removal pending", "Ended · removed, not yet verified" or "Ended · removal verified".

**Tracking**
- **Access Requests:** shows where each request really stands:

  ```text
  waiting for approval ─▶ waiting for fulfilment ─▶ not yet verified ─▶ verified
  ```

  It may also show failed or ended.
- **"Waiting for you":** brings together the approvals and tasks that need you.

---

## 8. Making the change: by a person or automatically

An approved request is not access yet. It becomes access once the change is made in the system and WonderID sees it there.

**By a person: fulfilment tasks**
- **Where tasks go:** each approved change opens a task for whoever the application names under "Fulfilled by": a person or a group, optionally per entitlement type; otherwise the application's owner. They are notified.
- **Groups:** any member of the group can claim a group's task.
- **Reassigning:** a task can be handed to someone else with a reason; the new assignee is notified, and the handover is audited.
- **Workload:** the fulfilment page shows how many open and overdue tasks each person and group has.
- **Working a task:** the assignee claims it, makes the change in the system, and marks it done or failed (with a reason).
- **Deadlines:** tasks are due within a set time (3 days by default) and send a daily reminder when overdue.
- **Closing:** a task closes itself when the next sync confirms the change.
- **Where:** Access Governance → Fulfilment Tasks.

**Automatically: connections that make the change themselves**
- **What they can do:** a connection can carry out approved changes:
  - remove access;
  - disable accounts;
  - add access;
  - create accounts.
- **Off until switched on:** this is off until an administrator turns it on for that connection (the connection's page → "Changes in the system"), and only for the changes its type supports.
- **No account yet:** for someone with no account, the connection creates the account first, then adds the access once the account appears.
- **One key per change:** every try at the same change sends the system the same key, so a system that supports these keys makes the change once.
- **Temporary errors:** a rate limit, or a system that could not be reached, is retried twice.
- **Unclear outcome:** after a timeout, a dropped connection or a server error, the system may have made the change anyway.
  - If the connection type marks the change as repeatable (sending it twice can't make it twice), it is retried twice.
  - Otherwise it is not sent again. WonderID reads the system: if the change is there, the task closes by itself. "Try again" works only once that read has finished.
  - Directory (LDAP) changes are always repeatable. For SCIM, adding, removing and disabling are repeatable; creating a user is not.
- **Verified:** after the change, WonderID reads the system again and marks it verified only if the change is really there.
- **If it fails:** the task goes back to its owner with the reason. They can do it by hand or press "Try again".
- **Not confirmed:** if a removal was marked done but the system still has not confirmed it 2 days later, its owner is reminded daily to check.
- **Escalated:** a removal or account disable more than a day overdue goes to the organization's access managers, once.

**Limit on mass changes**
- A connection may make at most 100 changes an hour by default. You can change this in Global Configuration → Connections.
- Past the limit, nothing more is sent and the extra changes become tasks for people.

**Automation credentials**
- Your own tools, such as pipelines or ticketing systems, can call WonderID's API with their own credential instead of a person's login.
- **Ownership and approval:** each credential belongs to an application identity and needs a second administrator to approve it. Giving it another role pauses it until a different administrator approves the change.
- **Limits:** it expires within a year (the database refuses anything longer), can be limited to certain network addresses, and is rate-limited.
  The address is the one the platform's edge reports, never one the caller sends. This is tested every night at the production edge.
- **The secret:** it is shown once. Only a fingerprint of it is kept.
- **What it can do:** only what its roles allow. It can never approve access, certify, approve an onboarding or manage automation credentials: those are people's decisions. It can never delegate or be delegated to; its roles change only on its own page.
- **Audit:** every call it is allowed to make is audited. Refused calls are audited too, whether the credential is pending, revoked or expired, the address is not allowed, or it is over its rate limit. To keep the record readable, each reason is recorded at most once a minute per credential.
- **Where:** Settings → Automation Credentials.

## 9. Risk and findings

**Risk scoring**
- Every agent and identity gets a risk score from fixed, explainable rules, never from AI alone.
- Weights are configurable.

**Findings**
Findings are raised for:
- access beyond the approved purpose;
- unauthorized actions;
- sensitive-data use;
- behaviour that drifts from normal;
- missing owners or lifecycle problems;
- rogue agents;
- rogue access.

**Rogue access**
- **Raising:** access that appeared in a system with no approval raises a finding.
- **One ticket per account:** a rogue account gets one ticket, such as **RA-000012**, numbered in order within your organization. Everything rogue found on that account belongs to the same ticket. You can quote the number in conversations and other tools; it shows on the account page and in Risk Overview.
- **Fixing:** for each piece of rogue access, a reviewer clicks **Remove access**, which raises an ordinary request under the application's rules. The request quotes the account's ticket number.
- **Other outcomes:** under **Other outcomes** on the account page, someone with risk-management permission, and never the account's owner, can instead:
  - accept it as an **exception** until a date at most 90 days away, with a reason. The finding reopens on that date, and the ticket stays open meanwhile;
  - close it as a **false positive**, with a reason. The same access is not flagged again.
  Both are kept on the finding; the audit trail records the decision and a fingerprint of the reason.
- **Closing:** the ticket stays open until all of the account's rogue access is dealt with. Each finding records how: **removed** (confirmed by a later sync), or **approved afterwards**, with the request that approved it attached. The access history keeps the earlier Rogue status either way. If rogue access turns up on the same account later, a new ticket opens.

**Investigations**
- Group findings and evidence into a case and work it to a conclusion.
- AI can help summarise; a person concludes.

**Governance drift**
- Flags agents whose contract, ownership or access has drifted from what was approved.

**Where:** Intelligence → Risk Overview.

---

## 10. Reviews, policies and compliance

**Access reviews (certifications)**
- **Campaigns:** each campaign covers a chosen set of identities, applications or agents.
- **Decisions:** reviewers keep, revoke or change each piece of access. For people's access and WonderID roles they can also defer (a new due date, at most 30 days away), escalate (to whoever launched the campaign) or make an exception (keep the access until a date, at most 90 days away; it is then removed automatically). An exception is not available for a role that comes from a group, and nobody makes one for their own access.
- **Overdue items:** escalated automatically.
- **Calendar and analytics:** the campaigns page has a **Calendar** tab (open campaigns by the month they are due, past due first) and an **Analytics** tab (items reviewed, completion, share revoked, open and overdue items, average time to decide, outcomes, each scope, and the reviewers with the most overdue items). Every figure is counted from the campaigns' own items; one that can't be computed shows "—".
- **Templates and preview:** a launch can be saved as a template (scope, who reviews, cadence, days to review) and launched again in one click; Preview counts the items, identities, high-risk items and reviewers a campaign would have before it is launched.
- **Asking someone:** when a reviewer needs more information, they choose "request information" and can name a colleague by email (the person whose access it is, its owner, anyone who knows). That person is notified, answers once on their own page, and the question and answer stay with the item as evidence. The reviewer still decides.
- **Evidence:** each decision is captured as evidence.
- **Who can review:** reviewers can't review their own access.
- **People's access:** a campaign can cover the application access people, contractors and service accounts hold (all of it, one application, or privileged access only). Each item goes to the person's manager, the application's owner or a named reviewer; the named reviewer takes items nobody else fits. A revoke becomes a removal that is already approved, carried out by a task or the connection, and counted as done only once the system no longer shows it.
- **WonderID roles:** a campaign can cover the roles members hold in WonderID itself, directly or through a group (all of them, or privileged roles only, which are listed first). Each item shows the person, the role and where it comes from, and goes to the person's manager or a named reviewer. A revoke takes effect at once: the role is removed, or the person leaves the group the role comes from. Automation credentials are reviewed on their own page.
- **Access packages and roles (owner review):** a campaign can cover what each active access package or role contains (all of them, or one). A role's owner reviews what the role itself contains; what it includes is reviewed with the included role. Each item is one application or entitlement in a package and goes to the package's owner, or the named reviewer when the package has none. Certify keeps it; revoke removes it from the package at once. People who already hold the package keep their access, and a birthright package waits for its approval again.
- **Applications (owner review):** a campaign can cover the entitlements of active applications (all, or one). Each item is one entitlement the application offers for certification. It goes to the entitlement's owner, or else the application's business owner, or else the named reviewer. Certify keeps it; revoke disables it, so nobody can request it any more. People who already hold it keep it until an access review removes it.

**Policies**
- Access and agent policies have targets and a priority.
- They move from **draft** to **published**, and every version is kept.

**Separation of duties**
- Define pairs of actions one person must not both perform for the same AI agent, for example requesting access and then approving it.
- **Preventive:** a policy set to block stops the second action on agent requests and grants; otherwise it is flagged.
- **Detective:** the Control Center reports people who performed both actions in a recent period.
- **History:** each change to a policy, including adding a rule, is a new version and applies at once; the policy's page lists every version, who made it and what changed.
- **Access that must not be combined:** a rule names access on one side and the access it must not be held with on the other (for example create vendor and approve payment). It applies to every kind of identity and is checked when access is requested, when a package or role is requested or assigned (birthright and identity rules included), and again when someone approves. What the identity holds includes access approved but not yet set up.
  - A blocking rule refuses with the reason. A warning rule lets it go ahead, but always to a person, never approved automatically, and the conflict is recorded on the request.
  - **Already held:** SoD Violations lists identities that hold a forbidden combination now.
  - **Roles:** the role simulation shows any conflict adding a role would create.
  - **Not yet provided:** exceptions with an owner, an expiry and a compensating control; a rule that asks for an extra approver instead of refusing.

**Compliance**
- **Control frameworks:** controls are mapped to SOX ITGC, SOC 1, PCI DSS, GLBA, DORA, RBI, SEBI CSCRF, CERT-In, GDPR and DPDP.
- **Governance posture and attestation:** show how well the organization is meeting its controls.
- **Governance evidence pack:** download it as a PDF for auditors.
- **What this means:** WonderID gives your auditors evidence; it never claims your organization *is* compliant.

---

## 11. Users, ID roles and permissions

**Users**
- **Inviting:** invite people one at a time or in bulk from a CSV (preview first).
- **Invitations:** they expire after 30 days and can be re-sent.
- **From the HR import:** an identity source can name a default ID role (never the organization administrator role). Each new person it imports with an email is invited to WonderID with that role, on the authority of whoever chose it; people already in WonderID are left as they are.
- **From an identity:** Add user can start from a person already under Identities (their name, email, title and department fill in), and a person's page has "Give WonderID access" when they can't sign in yet.

**ID roles**
- ID roles decide who can manage WonderID itself. They are different from the roles people hold in your applications, which WonderID governs.
- Built-in (system) and custom ID roles are made from a catalog of permissions.
- An invitation or ID role assignment can never give more than the person giving it holds, and nobody can give themselves an ID role.
- **On a person's page:** the ID Roles tab shows the ID roles a person holds. An administrator who can assign roles adds one there ("Add ID role") or removes one. A person who can't sign in to WonderID yet needs WonderID access first.

**Groups**
- Assign ID roles to a group instead of each person.

**Scoped permissions**
- Give a permission for one application, one area or one kind of object, instead of the whole organization.

**Single sign-on**
- Connect your organization's identity provider.
- Members are created only after a real single sign-on.

**Where:** Admin → Users & Roles (Users, ID Roles, Permissions); a person's own page under Identities.

---

## 12. Audit, reports, notifications and search

**Audit trail**
- Every security-relevant action is recorded: who, what, when, the outcome and related records.
- **Tamper-evident:** records can't be edited, and each one is chained to the one before. They are deleted only by your audit retention policy: oldest first, never the last 365 days, never under a legal hold.
- **How long by default:** 1 year on Free and Pro, 3 years on Max, 7 years on Enterprise. Never less than a year.
- **Identifiers, not people:** audit records name people and accounts by their ids, never by email, name or login; values from outside systems that may identify someone are kept as fingerprints.
- **What people type stays out of it:** reasons, comments, notes and justifications are kept on the request, task or finding they belong to, where privacy erasure can reach them. The audit record keeps a fingerprint, which proves what was written without revealing it.
- **What changed, field by field:** when someone edits a role, group, policy, rule, application, package, template, data source or identity source, the record lists each field that changed with its old and new value. On the Audit Trail, open "N changes" under the action. Typed text and secrets show only that they changed.
- **Integrity check:** Audit → Integrity proves the chain is intact.

**Reports and exports**
- Ready-made governance reports, exported as files.

### Creating reports

What an administrator can use today, and what is planned. Everything
runs inside your organization and respects the viewer's permissions.

**Today: ready-made reports** (Administration › Reports & Audit › Reports, permission `report.read`)
- Ten reports, computed live when you open them:
  - agent inventory;
  - ownership;
  - access certification;
  - rogue agents;
  - access violations;
  - risk;
  - audit evidence;
  - policy compliance;
  - revocation closure: every revoke decided in an access review, and whether the access is confirmed gone at the source (WonderID roles and agent grants are removed when decided);
  - leaver removal SLA: each leaver's removals of the last 90 days against their due date (on time, late, overdue, open or failed).
- Each one downloads as CSV, or is read as JSON through the API:
  - `GET /api/v1/reports/{type}`;
  - `GET /api/v1/reports/{type}/export?format=csv`.
- A report can be saved under a name with its filters (`POST /api/v1/reports`), so a team reuses the same view.

**Today: export any list, then build the report where you like**
- Every main list has an **Actions → Export** menu that downloads it as CSV. The list includes identities, accounts, applications, entitlements, access grants, requests, packages, findings, investigations, campaigns, runtime events, audit events and jobs.
- Exports carry names, not just ids (the owner's name, the application's name), so they open cleanly in a spreadsheet or a BI tool.
- The same exports are available to scripts: `GET /api/v1/exports/{object}`. An automation credential with read-only roles can pull them on a schedule into Power BI, Tableau, Looker or a data warehouse. That is the quickest way to build any report WonderID does not have yet.

**Planned: your own reports in WonderID** (not built yet; on the Operations backlog as the custom report builder)
- **A report builder, not raw SQL.** You pick a dataset, then choose:
  - its columns;
  - filters, such as "application is SAP and privilege is admin";
  - grouping and counts, such as accounts by application;
  - sorting.

  You save it with a name and share it with roles.
- **Datasets** are governed, read-only views of identities, accounts, access grants, entitlements, requests, findings, reviews, agents and audit events. Each view already joins the names you need.
- **Optional SQL mode** for analysts:
  - a single `SELECT` over those datasets only, never over the underlying tables;
  - run read-only, with a time limit and a row cap;
  - limited to your organization by the database's row-level security.

  Other organizations' data and secrets are never reachable, and a query cannot change anything.
- **Scheduling:** a saved report can be emailed or exported on a schedule, under the same permissions as the person who owns it.
- **Why not plain SQL on the database?**
  - WonderID holds many organizations in one database. Every query must stay inside yours.
  - Some columns hold personal data or credentials that only certain roles may see.

  The governed datasets enforce both, so a report can never show more than its viewer may see.

**Notifications**
- In the app and by email.
- Choose which ones you receive.

**Job status**
- Shows the progress of long-running work such as syncs and exports.

**Search**
- One search box across the whole product.

## 13. Privacy

**For members:** My Privacy shows your data, your consents and your requests.
- You can withdraw consent in one click.

**For administrators:** the privacy centre (Settings → Privacy) handles:
- **Requests:** access and erasure requests, with the legal deadlines built in (GDPR, UK GDPR, DPDP, CCPA).
- **Erasure:** needs two people, and never touches the audit trail.
  It pseudonymises the person, their account names, the values sources sent about them, and the email, login and name in connector changes. An account's reference in its system stays while the account exists there, so its access is still governed. The result lists what a source or system still holds: erase it there, or the next import brings it back.
- **Consent:** records of who agreed to what, with the notice version they saw.
- **Retention:** applied daily. Legal holds always win.
- **Breaches:** records with their notification deadlines.

---

## 14. Billing

- **Plans:** paid on the provider's own secure page: Stripe in USD and EUR, Razorpay in INR. WonderID never sees card or bank details.
- **Invoices:** numbered without gaps and never changed after they are issued.
- **Tax:** Indian GST is calculated automatically.
- **Plan changes:** they show only once the payment provider confirms them.
- **Refunds and overrides:** need a second person.

**Where:** Settings → Billing.

---

## 15. Organization settings

**Global Configuration**
- Organization-wide settings. Every change is saved as a new version.
- Settings include:
  - session length;
  - how long before an account counts as dormant;
  - how long fulfilment tasks have;
  - the mass-missing threshold;
  - the hourly limit on changes made by connections;
  - review defaults.
- **Export and import:** settings and identity attributes tried in Dev or Test can be moved to another environment. Export downloads a signed file. Importing it elsewhere first lists every setting it would change, from and to, and every attribute it would add, restore or retire, then saves the settings as a new version. An attribute defined differently there is left as it is. A file edited after export is refused.

**AI provider**
- Choose OpenAI or Gemini, using WonderID's key or your own.
- AI is used for summaries and proposals. Its output is always labelled as AI-generated, and it never decides anything.

**Email (SMTP)**
- Send the organization's e-mail (notifications and invitations) through its own mail server, from its own address.
- Enter the server, SSL/TLS or STARTTLS, port, user name, password and From address, then send a test e-mail to yourself. The page shows whether the last test was sent or failed, and why.
- The password is stored encrypted and never shown again. Without a server, or with it turned off, WonderID's own provider sends the e-mail as before.

**Also here:** organization name, web address, branding and notification settings.

---

## 16. Vendor administration

These pages are for the WonderID service operator only, never for customers:
- **Organizations:** manage organizations and their subscriptions.
- **Feature flags.**
- **Usage and limits.**
- **Maintenance mode and announcements.**
- **Platform branding and health.**
- **Billing and refunds.**
- **Platform audit trail.**

---

## 17. Safety and trust

| Risk | What protects you |
|---|---|
| One organization seeing another's data | Every record carries its organization and the database itself refuses access across organizations; this is tested for every feature |
| A bad file or feed makes everything look deleted | The mass-missing guard holds the sync for a person to approve |
| A runaway rule or bad approvals change too much | At most 100 changes per connection per hour, by default |
| A change applied twice | Every attempt carries a key that systems supporting it use to ignore repeats; changes are verified by reading the system again |
| "Done" without it really being done | Nothing is verified until WonderID reads the system again |
| A connection writing when it shouldn't | Changes are off until an administrator turns them on, and only for what the connection type supports |
| Someone approving their own access | Not allowed; key actions need a second person |
| AI making a decision | AI only suggests; fixed rules and people decide |
| Leaked passwords or keys | Secrets are encrypted, shown masked, never logged, and never sent to the browser |
| Tampering with the record | The audit trail can't be edited, is chained, and is purged only by retention policy |

**Also built in:**
- strict browser security headers;
- protection against requests forged from other sites;
- a dependency vulnerability check on every change.

---

## 18. Coming soon

- **Groups pushed over SCIM**, and standard security events (RFC 9967) from identity providers.
- **A relay** to reach systems inside your own network without opening it up.
- **Ready-made connections** for Microsoft Entra ID, an HR system (Workday or SuccessFactors) and ServiceNow ticketing.
- **Reviews for every identity type** on joiner, mover and leaver events.
- **Your own reports:** a report builder over governed datasets, with an optional read-only SQL mode (see [Creating reports](#creating-reports)).

## Revision history

Newest first.

| Date | What changed |
|---|---|
| 20 Oct 2026 | An application's page has two new tabs: Policies (the request policies that apply to it and who approves under each, with a link to change them) and Audit History (the latest changes to the application, its entitlements and entitlement types). |
| 20 Oct 2026 | The Email (SMTP) page has a Provider list (GoDaddy, Gmail, Microsoft 365, Outlook.com, SendGrid, Mailgun, Zoho Mail and others) that fills in the server, security and port. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | Request Policies is simpler: choosing a scope opens its policy straight away, and the form has three parts (who can request, approval, how long access lasts). One "Approved by" choice lists your approval workflows and the built-in routes, replacing three separate fields. Each policy's name opens its form. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | Entitlements and Onboard Application moved to Administration › Applications, and Request Policies to Administration › Policies & Controls, since configuring them is an administrator's job. Their pages and who can open them are unchanged. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | An approval workflow's page links to the next step: each request policy that uses it opens at its own form, an unused workflow links to setting a request policy, and a line under the levels links to where its approvers are set (managers, owners, groups, access managers). |
| 20 Oct 2026 | Approval Workflows moved from the Access menu to Administration › Integrations, since setting them up is an administrator's job. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | Organization Settings has a new Email (SMTP) page: the organization's notifications and invitations can be sent through its own mail server, with a test e-mail to check the settings. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | My requests also lists the requests someone raised for you, marked "For you". The header shows your name in the organization when your account has no display name, instead of your email. |
| 20 Oct 2026 | The requests list starts each line with its request number (a link to the request) and date, and a waiting request says whom it is waiting on. |
| 19 Oct 2026 | Pages open faster: signing in is checked once beside the database instead of from far away on every page, busy pages load their data at the same time instead of one piece after another, and housekeeping runs after a page is shown. Cancelling a request now also closes its approval steps. |
| 19 Oct 2026 | Get Help has Release notes: each release, newest first, with its date, version and the features it brought, each linked to its help section. It replaces the short "What's new" list. |
| 19 Oct 2026 | The in-app help guide is up to date with recent changes: approval workflows, request numbers, record numbers in page addresses, application tabs and requestable entitlements, self-approval of your own onboarding by an administrator, account name formats, the guided connection-type editor, MCP tools that are AI agents, a source's default ID role, the ID Roles tab, and what "couldn't check" messages mean. |
| 18 Oct 2026 | Approval workflows: reusable approval patterns with several levels (manager, manager's manager, owners, a named person, a group, access managers), all or any one per level, levels by risk; a request policy chooses one, so many applications share it. |
| 18 Oct 2026 | Separation of duties over access: rules on access one identity must not hold together, checked at request, assignment and approval; identities already holding both are listed. |
| 18 Oct 2026 | Business and IT roles: a kind of access package that can include other roles, with a simulation of adding or removing one. Owner reviews cover roles too. |
| 18 Oct 2026 | Global Configuration export and import also carry identity attributes. |
| 18 Oct 2026 | Nobody can merge their own person record, and merging two records with no shared email or name needs a reason. Automation credentials can't join groups. A vendor-console bootstrap address signed in by email must have been confirmed by a mailed link. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | A person can let an AI agent act for them (or an agent for another agent), once the agent's owner approves; the Runtime Gateway holds any request made on someone's behalf without such a delegation. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | Every change to a governance policy, including its separation of duties rules, is a new version; the policy's page shows its change history. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | Global Configuration can be exported as a signed file and imported into another environment, with a preview of every change first. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | Access review campaigns have a Calendar of what is due each month and Analytics: completion, revocations, time to decide, overdue items and reviewer backlog. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | Two records of the same person can be compared side by side and merged, keeping the values you choose, and the merge can be undone. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | Identity rules can add a person to a group or assign an access package, either after a person approves it or automatically. |
| 17 Oct 2026 | When WonderID cannot check someone's access because a database read failed, it now says "We couldn't check your access" instead of "forbidden" or sending them to set up an organization. |
| 16 Oct 2026 | The help centre needs sign-in, and its guide now matches today's menu and pages, with new sections on rogue accounts, provisioning tasks, delegations and My Team, identity rules and API clients. |
| 16 Oct 2026 | Merges happen as soon as checks pass, and the full test suite runs every night at 03:00 IST. |
| 16 Oct 2026 | "Give WonderID access" on a person's page now fills in their details in organizations with more than 500 people too. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | Access reviews can cover an application's entitlements: each entitlement's owner, or else the application's owner, keeps it or disables it so nobody can request it. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | Identity rules can open a task about a person, for their manager or identity administrators, instead of only setting a detail. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | Access reviews can cover what access packages contain: each package's owner certifies or removes each application and entitlement in it. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | Identity rules can run when a person becomes active, moves, gets a new manager, leaves or reaches their end date, not only when they are created, imported or an attribute changes. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | The audit trail now shows what a configuration change changed: each field with its old and new value, under "N changes" beside the action. Typed text and secrets show only that they changed. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | When an MCP server says which of its tools are AI agents, WonderID believes it: those tools are listed under **AI agents** on the MCP page, marked "Declared by the server", with what the server says they may do ("Answers only" or "Drafts only") and whether their output is AI-generated. Servers that say nothing are judged by the tool's name and description, as before. |
| 15 Oct 2026 | Tools found on an MCP server that are themselves AI agents (they draft, answer or generate, like a "draft reply" tool) are labelled **AI agent** on the MCP page, with the reason, and appear in Agent Discovery so you can register them as agents. Every object page now opens at a short number (for example /identities/12), and old links still work. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | An account that an approved request creates now has a readable name (for example jane.doe) instead of an internal reference. An application's onboarding can set the account name format; older requests' accounts show "to be created". |
| 14 Oct 2026 | On a phone, the bottom bar is gone: a floating **More** button at the bottom right opens the full menu. Pages now have short addresses: an access request is at its number (/access/requests/42), and old links still work. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Every access request now has a number to quote, REQ and nine digits, shown with an animated barcode when you submit it, on the request's page and in the requests list. Earlier requests were numbered in the order they were made. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | WonderID's own roles are now called "ID roles" everywhere (the sidebar, the ID Roles page, users, groups and permissions), to tell them apart from roles in your applications. A person's page has an ID Roles tab that shows the ID roles they hold, where an administrator can add or remove one. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | An application's entitlements show "Requestable" only when someone can really request them; without a request policy they show "Needs a request policy", and the request catalog says why. The onboarding Approve button now works for an administrator's own submission. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | An HR import (identity source) can give new people WonderID access: choose a default ID role on the source's page, and each new person it imports with an email is invited with it. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | An administrator can approve an application onboarding they submitted (a note is required and it is recorded as self-approved). Add user can start from a person already under Identities, and a person's page has "Give WonderID access". |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Creating a record from a list page now starts from the page's Actions menu, in a window over the list, instead of a form at the bottom of the page (policies, investigations, groups, data sources, discoveries, attributes, rules, templates, delegations, campaigns, privacy records, single sign-on and more). |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Entitlements and entitlement types: more attributes, edit, disable and delete from a row menu, shown as tables; onboarding shown in the application's Onboarding tab. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | An entitlement added by hand must be under one of the application's entitlement types. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Application pages have tabs (Details, Entitlements, Onboarding, Accounts, Settings); entitlements can be added by hand on the Entitlements tab. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Access reviews: a reviewer can ask a colleague about an item; the answer is kept with the item. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Two control-evidence reports: revocation closure (is each revoked access really gone?) and leaver removal SLA (were leavers' removals done in time?). Correction: switching inside one installed app works on a computer only; on phones it opens in the browser's overlay. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Access review templates: save a campaign's settings and launch it again in one click; Preview shows what a campaign will hold before it starts. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | One installed app for every organization and environment: install from the main address, and switching stays inside the app (Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet). |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Vendor console access now comes only from the platform administrators list. An address set in the hosting environment can only open Platform Admins to add someone (or itself) to that list; every grant is audited. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Access reviews of people and WonderID roles can defer an item, escalate it to whoever launched the campaign, or keep the access as an exception until a date, after which it is removed. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Access reviews can cover the WonderID roles members hold, directly or through a group, privileged roles first; nobody certifies their own role, and a revoke removes it at once. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Delegation never involves an automation credential, in either direction: its roles change only on its own page. The vendor console's listed-address path no longer accepts enterprise SSO or Microsoft-only sign-ins, and its first use is recorded in the platform audit. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Access reviews cover people's application access too: reviewed by the manager, the application owner or a named reviewer; a revoke becomes an approved removal, verified at the source. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | In organizations with two or more Tenant Administrators, a change to a request policy waits for someone else to approve it, showing what it changes; every applied change is kept as a numbered version. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Administration can be handed to a colleague for a time: they get copies of the person's roles until the end date, removed at once if it ends early. Tenant Administrator is never handed over. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Your request rights can be handed to a colleague for a time: they ask for access on your behalf, both of you are recorded, and neither of you approves it. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Connection types can be written in a guided form beside the JSON, with field paths picked from a sample response. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Approved access for someone with both an everyday and an admin account on an application goes to their everyday account; admin access still waits for a person to choose. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Approvals can be handed to a colleague while you are away, until a date; they decide on your behalf and both of you are recorded. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Approvers get a message with a link to the request; requests can be saved as drafts and finished later. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Several requests at once: a basket of access for one or more people, or the same access as a colleague (model after). |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Fulfilment tasks go to a person or a group chosen per application (and per entitlement type); a group's members claim them, tasks can be reassigned with a reason, and a workload view shows who has what. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Onboarding templates per connection type, with a questionnaire, so each application is onboarded the same way. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Entitlement types per application, and classification rules that set an entitlement's privilege and data classification, published by a second person. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | Identities can end on their end date, and a manager can disable all of a person's access at once; attribute rules run on the shared rule engine with a stored run log. |
| 14 Oct 2026 | The identity page has Groups, Risk and Activity tabs. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | Access review campaigns are built in the background, so launching one never makes you wait. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | Reporting: how to create reports today (ready-made reports, exports of every list for spreadsheets and BI tools) and the planned report builder. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | New navigation: Home, My Workspace, Access, AI Agents, Access Reviews, Risk & Detection, Self Service, then Administration with its own sidebar. New pages: Rogue Accounts, Onboarding Reviews. The dashboard now summarizes the whole platform. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | When someone moves and no longer qualifies for a birthright package, their manager has 14 days to keep it; otherwise it is removed. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | An organization can require two-step verification. Members then verify with an authenticator app, or set one up, before they see anything; automation credentials are exempt. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | Separation of duties described as it is: it covers the same person performing two actions for an AI agent; rules on combinations of access are not provided yet. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | An organization can limit the hosts its connections may reach; everything else is refused, redirects included. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | Birthright packages: people who join, are rehired or move get the packages meant for them automatically. Two administrators turn birthright on, and a change to the package needs approval again. |
| 13 Oct 2026 | An address that names no organization now answers "not found" (404) on the live service too, not only locally. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | An automation credential limited to certain addresses is now tested every night at the production edge: a caller who forges the address headers is refused. Where the address comes from, per deployment, is in the security controls. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Erasure now also reaches the person's account names, the values their sources sent, and the email, login and name in connector changes, for guests and partners as well as staff. It reports what a source or system still holds, to be erased there. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Audit records hold identifiers, not personal data: accounts, people and outside systems' ids are recorded by id or as a fingerprint, never as an email, name or login. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Reasons, comments and notes people type are no longer copied into audit records: they stay on the request, task or finding, and the audit record keeps a fingerprint of them. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | An account unlinked from a person is matched again at the next sync, but never back to that person without someone deciding; undoing a wrong source match also re-matches that person's accounts. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A source record matched to the wrong person can be unlinked from the person's page: the details it changed are restored (unless they changed since), and it is never matched to that person again without someone deciding. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | When two identity sources disagree on a detail, the higher-priority source still wins, and the disagreement is listed with both values and sources for review; it clears itself once they agree. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Rogue access on an account can be accepted as an exception (up to 90 days) or closed as a false positive, with a reason, by someone other than the account's owner. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A "gateway only" setting per agent: acting around the gateway is critical and suspends the agent at the gateway. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | When someone leaves, a connection that can disable accounts (with changes turned on) disables their account at once; people still remove each access. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Audit records are kept at least a year on every plan: 1 year on Free and Pro, 3 years on Max, 7 years on Enterprise. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A sync that reads fewer records than the system says it holds counts as partial and marks nothing missing. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A connection's change sends the system one key however often it is tried; a change that may already have been made is checked by reading the system before it is sent again. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A sync is held when every record of a kind would go missing at once, at any size; people are held at a lower share than other records. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | An account matched to a person stays with them when an email address or username is reused; the sync results say so. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Rogue access that was approved later is recorded as "approved afterwards", with its request, never as fixed. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A sync cut short at a limit counts as partial, so the next sync still reads everything it missed. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Agents that act without asking the Runtime Gateway, or despite a "no", now get a gateway bypass finding. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Identity providers and HR systems can push people to WonderID over SCIM 2.0 as they join, change and leave. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | When someone leaves, each access they hold becomes its own removal task, due within a day; removals more than a day overdue go to the access managers. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Ended access shows whether it is really gone; removing access and disabling accounts are due within a day; refused automation calls are audited, and the database caps automation credential expiry at a year. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | A role given to an automation credential pauses it until a second administrator approves; owners are reminded about removals that the system has not confirmed. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Stronger safeguards: emergency controls block in every gateway mode; high-risk access always needs a person; nobody approves their own request; automation credentials never approve or certify. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Any application with a SCIM 2.0 service can be connected and make approved changes (add and remove group members, disable and create users); LDAP directories can add and remove group members. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Connection types can be downloaded and opened elsewhere, and a connection can move to a newer version after a preview; this guide was corrected where it promised more than the product does. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Connections can sign in with the provider: an administrator presses Connect and approves on the system's own sign-in page. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Connections can sign in with a private key instead of a shared secret, or with a client certificate. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Every rogue account gets a ticket number (RA-000001, …), one per account, that closes once the account is fixed. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | This guide rewritten to cover the whole product. |
| 12 Oct 2026 | Automation credentials for your own tools; connected systems that make approved changes themselves; removing rogue access through a request; a limit on mass changes; richer connection types; faster scheduled syncs that read only what changed. |
| 11 Oct 2026 | Detecting what was removed in a connected system; automatic flow after every sync; access imported from connected systems and labelled approved, legacy, unproven or rogue; service accounts and agents as owned identities; access requests that end verified, with tasks for application owners; time-bound access; one inbox; bulk invitations. |
| 10 Oct 2026 | The connection framework with built-in connectors; CSV import and export on every list; install on phones and tablets; the "why does this person have access" ledger; a separate Admin menu; Global Configuration. |
| 9 Oct 2026 | Help centre checked against the product; pricing on the website. |
| 2 Oct 2026 | Microsoft and LinkedIn sign-in; single sign-on creates members only after a real single sign-on. |
| 1 Oct 2026 | Billing (Stripe and Razorpay), privacy tools (GDPR, DPDP), a tamper-evident audit trail, financial and privacy control frameworks, security hardening. |
| 26 Sep 2026 | Identity sources and matching, joiner/mover/leaver with ownership transfer, the application catalog and onboarding, accounts inventory, application discovery, the request catalog, approvals and access packages, organization addresses and branding, users, roles, groups and scoped permissions. |
| 25 Sep 2026 | The product became **WonderID**: one directory for every kind of identity, not only AI agents. |
| 25 Sep 2026 | Light console design; per-agent API keys; the Runtime Gateway with emergency stop and tool filtering; inventories of non-human identities, shadow AI, MCP servers and data sources; investigations; separation-of-duties checks; policy drafts and publishing. |
| 19 Sep 2026 | More global search results, more notification triggers, an extra risk factor for privileged access. |
| 18 Sep 2026 | Faster pages, Google sign-in, the help centre with an ask-the-guide assistant, the real logo. |
| 17 Sep 2026 | Public website, redesigned screens, forgot-password, tables that turn into cards on phones. |
| 16 Sep 2026 | AI summaries (OpenAI or Gemini, your own key optional), email notifications, the governance evidence pack as a PDF, governance drift and posture, scheduled review escalation. |
| 15 Sep 2026 | New visual design; agent discovery became a full detect, review and register flow. |
| 14 Sep 2026 | Connections to other systems, effective access and policies, runtime activity, risk scoring and rogue-agent detection, access reviews, audit trail, reports, notifications, search, and the vendor administration console. Single sign-on and two-step verification. |
| 13 Sep 2026 | First version of the product: organizations, sign-in, roles and permissions, and AI agent identities with owners, lifecycle and approved purpose. |
