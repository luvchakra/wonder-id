# IGA and Agent ID: live progress

| | |
|---|---|
| Last updated | 2026-10-17 |
| Current phase | F3 in progress. The exit scenario runs end to end against a stub system (2026-10-12): rogue access removed through the connector after a reviewer asks, verified, finding resolved |
| Next story | By priority (owner, 2026-10-13): finish RISK-P0-13, then F4 (lifecycle rules, rule runtime, attribute rules, entitlement types, certification for every identity type) and the High QA sweeps. INTEGRATION stories are Low, implemented later. Up next and blocked lists: `../ROADMAP-STORIES.md` |
| Plan | `../run-order/RUN-ORDER.md` · Design `../design/DESIGN.md` |

**How to update this file.** In the same pull request as the work (CLAUDE.md
§4, "Record before you stop"): set the story's status, add a one-line note
with the migration or PR, and move "Current phase" and "Next story" when they
change. Status values: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Blocked`, `Partial`,
`Done`. A phase is done when every gating story is Done and the exit test
passed. This file is hand-maintained; the generated programme rollup
`docs/PROGRESS.md` covers the module backlogs and stays separate.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Approve the baseline; stories enter the backlogs | Approved 2026-10-11 (owner); F1 and F2 stories added to the module backlogs |
| D2 | OAuth tokens to agents | Approved 2026-10-12 (owner): yes, scoped to agents and the gateway and opt-in MCP audiences; workforce sign-in stays with the customer's IdP |
| D3 | Connector writes | Approved 2026-10-12 (owner): yes, per connection, declared, tenant-enabled and approval-gated; disable/enable and remove access first, then create and add |
| D4 | Automatic agent suspension | Open |
| D5 | Password reset showing a value | Open (recommendation: no) |
| D6 | Auto-close certification decisions | Open (recommendation: not in P0) |
| D7 | Outbound-only relay | Open |
| D8 | SCIM receiver and AuthZEN as public receivers | Open |
| D9 | First connectors | Open (recommendation: Entra ID, Workday, AWS) |
| D10 | Import frequency on the free plan | Open (recommendation: daily plus run now) |
| D11 | Automation credentials | Approved 2026-10-12 (owner): yes, with the §8.2 controls (hashed, expiring at most a year, role-scoped, four-eyes, audited, rate-limited, never for sign-in) |
| D12 | Shared rule runtime | Approved 2026-10-12 (owner): one shared runtime published by Operations; rule tables stay with their owners |

## Priorities

Every story's priority on `../ROADMAP-STORIES.md` comes from this table (owner request, 2026-10-13). The rows are read top to bottom and the first row that matches a story wins, so a row naming one story overrides the general rules under it. `Applies to` takes story IDs, a module prefix such as `INTEGRATION-*` (add `(unfinished)` to leave finished stories alone), phases `F1`–`F10`, `Deferred`, or `Product base`. After a change, run `npm run roadmap`.

| Applies to | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|
| EXPERIENCE-P0-32 | Medium | Owner request 2026-10-13: language picker in the header |
| ACCESS-P0-42 | High | Owner request 2026-10-14: internal fulfilment task assignment instead of ticketing first |
| INTEGRATION-P0-26 | Low | Owner decision 2026-10-14: ServiceNow fulfilment waits; internal assignment (ACCESS-P0-42) comes first |
| QA-P0-02.1, QA-P0-02.2, QA-P0-06 | High | Tenant-isolation, RBAC and sign-in coverage (CLAUDE.md §17.8, P0) |
| INTEGRATION-* (unfinished) | Low | Owner decision 2026-10-13: integration stories are implemented later |
| F10 | High | Release gate |
| F1, F2, F3, F4 | High | Current and next phases |
| F5, F6, F7 | Medium | Follow lifecycle and certification |
| F8, F9 | Low | Advanced governance and intelligence come last |
| Deferred | Low | Deferred in its backlog |
| Product base | Medium | Finishing the product base |

## Owner actions outside the plan

| Action | Status |
|---|---|
| Configure the Supabase SSO provider so SAML/OIDC sign-in works (FOUNDATION-P0-03.3) | Open |
| Rotate the Saviynt training-tenant password shared in chat on 2026-10-11 | Done 2026-10-12 (owner) |
| Disconnect the paused Vercel project `kunals-projects-9f64757f/wonder-id` from the repository | Done 2026-10-12 (owner) |
| Review the `wonderapps_dashboard` database role: it can sign in and reads every row of about 24 customer tables in all organizations (`using (true)` policies). No migration in the repository creates it; found 2026-10-11 by the advisors | Done 2026-10-13 (owner decision): it belongs to the WonderApps dashboard and stays, under an on/off switch in Platform Health (migration 0155); audited; never the AI provider keys |

## F1: Import and reconciliation

| Story | Module | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INTEGRATION-P0-18 Staging reflects the source | Integration | #42 | Done | PR #79; migration 0117; isolation SQL 19/19; held runs decided on the connection page |
| INTEGRATION-P0-19 Scheduled import and promotion | Integration | #43 | Done | PR #80; migration 0118; identities then accounts after every full sync, steps on the job; source schedules run. Entitlements and grants join with ACCESS-P0-27 |
| ACCESS-P0-27 Entitlement and grant reconciliation | Access | #44 | Done | PR #81; migration 0119; preview then apply on the application page; joins the post-sync chain; removal and return are ledger events |
| ACCESS-P0-25 Imported access classification and drift findings | Access + Risk | #45 | Done | PR #82; migration 0120; baseline per application; legacy / authorized / unproven / rogue; one Risk finding per rogue access, resolved when approved or removed |
| IDENTITY-P0-20 Non-human identities from accounts | Identity | #46 | Done | PR #83. Service/shared/machine accounts become owned or queued identities; agents' accounts link by declared identifiers; unowned subjects refused for requests |
| EXPERIENCE-P0-28 Reconciliation console | Experience | #47 | Done | Held runs, run now with progress, chain steps, preview and apply, classification and last seen at source, on the connection, application and account pages |
| QA-P0-23 Reconciliation suite | QA | #48 | Done | `tests/e2e/f1-reconciliation.spec.ts`, 7 tests (14 with sign-in setup) passed locally. Found and fixed: connector-sourced onboarding could never validate |
| INTEGRATION-P0-20 Custom attributes as targets; schedule on every connection | Integration | #66 | Done | Mappings to custom attributes, typed and unique-checked by Identity, with provenance; schedule on every reading connection and its API. Does not gate |
| FOUNDATION-P0-31 Automation credentials | Foundation | #67 | Done | Migrations 0126–0127. Admin → Automation Credentials: one per application identity, secret shown once, four-eyes create and extend, expiry ≤ 1 year, CIDR allowlist, rate limit, rotate, revoke; `Bearer wa_ac_…` on /api/v1/* acts with its role only, every call audited; Global Configuration API; Configuration Administrator role |

Exit test: passed 2026-10-11 by the QA-P0-23 suite, on connector records seeded into staging (a live target is not reachable from the test). A person, an owned service account and an agent show accounts, entitlements and grants; a grant removed at the source is marked missing and its finding resolves; a grant added after the baseline is rogue with one finding.

## F2: Access requests end to end

| Story | Module | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACCESS-P0-28 Approved requests become pending grants | Access | #50 | Done | Migration 0121. Approval (chain, auto-approval, agent path, package items) adds a pending grant, on a placeholder account when the subject has none; Mark fulfilled → not yet verified; reconciliation verifies. Pending grants are not effective access |
| ACCESS-P0-29 Fulfilment tasks | Access | #51 | Done | Migration 0122. One task per pending grant for the application's owner; claim, done (grant unverified), fail with a reason; SLA in Global Configuration (3 days), daily reminder when overdue; closed as verified by reconciliation. Home › Access Governance › Fulfilment Tasks |
| ACCESS-P0-30 Remove-access and account requests | Access | #52 | Done | Migration 0123. Remove access (revoked when the source no longer lists it), a new account (placeholder until it appears), disable an account (until the source shows it disabled). Each request is one line with its own approval; multi-line baskets remain a separate item |
| ACCESS-P0-31 Requests for non-human identities | Access + Identity | #53 | Done | No migration. The owner of a service account or machine identity requests for it; an agent's business owner requests only what its contract approves (refused otherwise, server-side). Non-human requests are approved by the resource's owners |
| ACCESS-P0-32 Time-bound access | Access | #54 | Done | Migration 0124. End dates capped by policy; a reminder before the end with an Extend request (approved like any other); at the end, exactly one removal task per grant; the ledger shows EXPIRED once the source confirms the removal |
| EXPERIENCE-P0-29 Request tracking and tasks inbox | Experience | #55 | Done | No migration. Each request line shows its real state (waiting, approved, waiting for fulfilment, not yet verified, verified, failed, ended); "Waiting for you" lists fulfilment tasks with the approvals; For lists the people you manage and what you own |
| QA-P0-24 Request-to-verified suite | QA | #56 | Done | A person, a service account and an agent from request to verified; removal and expiry end revoked; approver ≠ requester; isolation SQL for 0123/0124 (11/11); a repeated reconciliation changes nothing |
| FOUNDATION-P0-32 Bulk invitation and invitation API | Foundation | #68 | Done | Migration 0125. Users → Import CSV… previews new, already-member and invalid rows and invites only the new; POST /api/v1/users/invitations (dry run; idempotent on e-mail); invitations expire (30 days by default) and can be sent again; roles never beyond the inviter's own permissions. Scripts use an automation credential (FOUNDATION-P0-31) |

Exit test: not run.

## F3: Provisioning

| Story | Module | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INTEGRATION-P0-11 (finish) Write interface with a caller | Integration | | Done | 2026-10-12. Definitions declare writes (`write`: revoke_access, disable_account, grant_access, create_account; http driver); a connection writes only after an administrator turns writes on (Connection → Changes in the system; audited); retryable failures marked |
| INTEGRATION-P0-13 Provisioning pipeline | Integration + Access | | Done | 2026-10-12. Slice 1 (migrations 0128–0129): remove-access and disable-account tasks done by the connector (claim, idempotent attempts, two retries, verification sync, reconciliation verifies); failures back to the owner with the reason, Try again, lost-run sweep. Slice 2 (no migration): approved access added and accounts created by the connector; access for someone with no account waits while the connector creates it, then is added once the account is read back. Ticketed fulfilment is INTEGRATION-P0-26 |
| INTEGRATION-P0-21 Definition extensions | Integration | #69 | Done | Slice 1 (2026-10-12): transforms `regex`, `replace`, `coalesce`, `dateAdd`; API key in the request body. Slice 2: incremental `changes` resources for scheduled syncs (full read at least daily; incremental runs mark nothing missing). Part 3a: private-key sign-in (`private_key_jwt`, `jwt_bearer`) and client certificates (mutual TLS). Part 3b: OAuth authorization code with PKCE. Part 4: export/import and connection upgrade with a preview |
| INTEGRATION-P0-22 † SCIM client; LDAP and http writes | Integration | | Partial | Backlog: Partial. SCIM 2.0 connection type and LDAP writes (#107); inbound SCIM receiver for users (#112, migration 0136). SCIM groups and RFC 9967 events follow |
| INTEGRATION-P0-23 † WonderID Relay | Integration | | Not started | Needs D7 |
| INTEGRATION-P0-24 † Entra ID connector | Integration | | Not started | Needs D9 |
| INTEGRATION-P0-25 † HR connector | Integration | | Not started | Needs D9 |
| INTEGRATION-P0-26 † ServiceNow ticketing | Integration | | Not started | Low (owner, 2026-10-14) |
| ACCESS-P0-42 Internal fulfilment task assignment | Access | | Done | Owner request 2026-10-14, High. Migration 0173: a person or group per application and per entitlement type; new tasks routed (type, application, technical owner, business owner, access managers); group members claim; reassign with a reason (audited, claim released, new assignee notified); workload per assignee; overdue reminders reach group members |
| RISK-P0-13 Rogue access remediation | Risk | | Done | Every remediation action, severity, trend and the finding page; the last, adding access to a package the identity holds, 2026-10-14 (#169). E2E passed in the nightly of 17 Oct |
| QA-P0-26 Provisioning safety suite | QA | | Done | 2026-10-12, no migration. The mass-change guard on writes: at most `integration.maxWritesPerHour` (default 100) changes per connection per hour; past it nothing is sent and the task goes to its owner with the reason. Tests in `connector-provisioning.spec.ts`: read-only types cannot be turned on, the guard, Try again once the limit allows, no attempt key sent twice, every operation verified |

## F4: Lifecycle and certification

| Story | Module | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OPERATIONS-P0-11 (runtime part) Shared rule runtime | Operations | #72 | Done | Condition language, evaluation, simulation, run log stored (`rule_runs`, 0167); first used by IDENTITY-P0-21 |
| IDENTITY-P0-21 Attribute rules and the rule catalogue | Identity | #70 | Done | 2026-10-14: attribute rules (created, imported, attribute changed), report-only, simulation, four-eyes publish, run log (0166). 2026-10-15: lifecycle triggers (activated, moved, manager changed, leaver, end date reached). 2026-10-15: the "open a task" effect (0194). 2026-10-17: add to a group and assign a package, each "a person approves" (an approval task) or "automatic" (owner decision 2026-10-17; migration 0197) |
| IDENTITY-P0-18 (finish) Lifecycle rules | Identity | | Done | Birthright (0151), mover review (0153), leaver removal (WID-C02), four-eyes rules (IDENTITY-P0-21); 2026-10-14: expiry sweep (0168) and the manager's "disable all access" (My Team) |
| IDENTITY-P0-17 (finish) Identity detail tabs | Identity | | Done | Groups, Risk and Activity tabs, #167 |
| ACCESS-P0-33 Entitlement types; classification rules | Access | #71 | Done | 2026-10-14: entitlement types per application (0169): how each is requested, certifiable, default and maximum duration; entitlement type, requestable and SOX flags with provenance; enforced on requests. Classification rules (0170) on the shared rule runtime: simulate, four-eyes publish, report-only then enforce (applied to existing entitlements), never over a person's value, run log. Owner: ownerless entitlements stay requestable |
| COMPLIANCE-P0-10 Certification for every identity type | Compliance | | Done | 2026-10-14 part 1 (0180, 0181): campaigns over people's application access, reviewed by the manager, the application owner or a named reviewer; certify (never one's own) or revoke as an approved removal verified at the source. Part 2 (0184): defer, escalate, exception (kept until a date, then removed). Part 3 (0193): owner reviews of access packages. Part 4 (0196): owner reviews of applications' entitlements. Part 5 (0199, 2026-10-17): campaign calendar and analytics. 2026-10-18: business-role owner reviews, through ACCESS-P0-21 (roles are packages) |
| COMPLIANCE-P0-11 Certification of administrators | Compliance | | Done | 2026-10-14 (0183): campaigns over WonderID role assignments, direct and through a group, privileged first; reviewed by the manager or a named reviewer, never one's own; a revoke removes the role or the group membership through Foundation's services |
| COMPLIANCE-P0-14 † Templates, preview, consultation, closed loop, SLA report | Compliance | | Done | 2026-10-14 part 1 (0185): campaign templates (save, launch, archive) and a preview that counts a campaign before launch. Part 2: reports "Revocation closure" (closed loop) and "Leaver removal SLA" (termination SLA). Part 3 (0186): consultation, a reviewer asks a member about an item; that member answers once; the answer stays with the item |
| IDENTITY-P0-23 † Human identity merge | Identity | | Done | 2026-10-17 (0198, owner decision): duplicates suggested by email or name; side-by-side compare with a per-attribute choice; the merge moves accounts and access, live packages, pending requests, open findings, reports, ownership, source records and the sign-in to the survivor in one transaction; history stays; audited; undo with a reason restores exactly what moved |
| FOUNDATION-P0-33 † Attribute-level audit detail | Foundation + Operations | | Done | 2026-10-15: old and new values per field on configuration edits, shown on the Audit Trail |

## F5: Roles, separation of duties and delegation

| Story | Module | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACCESS-P0-21 Business and IT roles | Access | | Partial | 2026-10-18 (0203): roles as a kind of access package, role hierarchy, simulation of add/remove. Left: SoD impact (waits on ACCESS-P0-22) |
| ACCESS-P0-22 Entitlement SoD | Access | | Not started | Backlog: Not Started |
| ACCESS-P0-23 Delegations | Access | | Done | 2026-10-14 part 1 (0176): approver delegation: time-limited, never to oneself, at most 180 days; the delegate decides named steps on the approver's behalf (both recorded and audited) and is notified; ended by either person or an access manager. Part 2 (0177): request delegation, where the delegate asks with the person's own request rights (never an access manager's), both are recorded, and neither approves it. Part 3 (0178): administration delegation, where the delegate gets time-bound copies of the person's roles (never Tenant Administrator) through Foundation's assignments, removed at once when ended early. 2026-10-17 part 4 (0200, owner decisions): person→agent and agent→agent delegation for named actions and applications, at most 180 days, in effect once an owner of the receiving agent approves (never the asker); the Runtime Gateway holds a request that names `onBehalfOf` for approval (DELEGATION_REQUIRED) unless an active delegation covers it |
| ACCESS-P0-35 † Approved changes to governance objects | Access | | Done | 2026-10-14 part 1 (0179): request policies. With two or more active Tenant Administrators (owner decision) a change waits, with its field-by-field diff, for someone else who manages access; approved, it applies as the next numbered version (refused if the policy moved on); one administrator saves at once, still versioned. 2026-10-17 (owner decisions): roles apply at once, with no second approver (already audited field by field). Governance policies, SoD rules included, apply at once and are versioned with what changed: adding a rule is a version, and each policy shows its change history. Lifecycle and attribute rules already publish under four-eyes. Workflows join when they exist (Phase 10) |
| ACCESS-P0-36 † SoD violation workflow; import guardrail | Access | | Not started | |

Left: bundles for the declarative objects (attributes, request policies, rules), and a second person's approval of an import |
| PLATFORM-P0-15 † Certified definitions | Platform | | Not started | |
| ACCESS-P0-34 Onboarding templates and questionnaire | Access | #74 | Done | 2026-10-14: templates per connection type (connector definition key) with configuration defaults, default owners, entitlement types and a questionnaire (0171, 0172); onboarding starts from a fitting template; required questions block validation; a changed answer means validating and approving again |
| ACCESS-P0-38 † Baskets, model-after, drafts, signed links | Access | | Done | 2026-10-14. Part 1 (#180, 0174): baskets of many lines for many people, each its own checked request; model-after with reasons. Part 2 (0175): approvers notified when a stage opens, each with a single-use 72-hour link that still needs their session; saved drafts |
| IDENTITY-P0-25 † Generated identifiers | Identity | | Not started | |
| EXPERIENCE-P0-30 Guided connector editor | Experience | #75 | Done | Form tab beside the JSON; one shared text, so it validates and publishes identically; field picker over a "Try it" sample |
