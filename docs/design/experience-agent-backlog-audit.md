## 2026-09-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-01 and P0-02 done; P0-03 partial

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`
(same environment-pinned-branch deviation every prior module recorded).

**Built:**

- **EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0** — Semantic design tokens in `app/globals.css`,
  exactly the names `docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md` §4 specifies
  (`background`, `surface`, `surface-elevated`, `border`, `text-primary/
  secondary/muted`, `accent`(+foreground), `success`/`warning`/`danger`/
  `info`), defined once on `:root` for light, redefined under
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` (guarded `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`)
  and again under `:root[data-theme="dark"]` so an explicit override wins
  both directions — matching the exact pattern this environment's artifact
  rules require, applied here to the actual product rather than an
  artifact. Dark palette is intentional (sophisticated dark neutrals,
  `#0f1115`/`#171a21`), not an inverted light palette. `ThemeFlashGuard`
  (an inline synchronous `<script>` in the root layout's `<head>`) sets
  `data-theme` before first paint from `localStorage`, avoiding a flash of
  the wrong theme; `ThemeToggle` (light/dark/system) lives in the shell's
  user menu. `modules/ui/*` primitives (`Badge`, `Card`, `Button`, `Table`,
  `States`) consume these tokens exclusively via Tailwind v4's `@theme
  inline` — no hardcoded hex colors in component code. Icon set: plain
  text/unicode glyphs only (☰ for the mobile nav toggle) — a real icon
  library (e.g. lucide-react) was deliberately not added this session to
  avoid an extra dependency for a single icon; flagged as a follow-up if
  more iconography is needed.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-01.1** — `app/(customer)/layout.tsx`: top bar
  (WonderAgent logo, tenant slug, user menu with theme toggle + tenant
  switcher + sign-out), left nav (exact PRD groups: AI Identity, Access
  Governance, Runtime Assurance, Risk & Compliance, Integrations, Reports,
  Administration), content area. **Every existing domain route was moved
  into the `app/(customer)/*` route group** (`git mv`, preserving history)
  so this layout actually wraps them — route groups don't affect URLs, so
  every path (`/agents`, `/access`, `/risk`, etc.) is unchanged; verified
  live (see below). Platform Admin is never referenced anywhere in this
  layout or nav — verified `grep -rn "platform-admin" "app/(customer)"
  modules/ui/` returns zero matches. **Two real gaps caught and fixed
  while wiring the nav**: `/risk` and `/runtime` had no index page (only
  `/risk/agents/:id` and `/runtime/agents/:id` existed, since neither Risk
  nor Runtime Agent's own backlog asked for a list view) — the nav would
  have 404'd. Added `app/(customer)/risk/page.tsx` and
  `app/(customer)/runtime/page.tsx`: thin composition-only tables over
  Identity's `listAgents()` plus (for Risk) `getFindings()`, linking to
  each existing per-agent detail page — no new business logic, no new
  tables, exactly within EXPERIENCE-P0-03's "thin composition" mandate.
  **Flagged, not silently assumed**: the tenant-switcher list needs "all
  of the user's active tenant memberships," which Foundation publishes no
  bulk-list contract for (only `getTenantContext()`, for the *current*
  tenant) — read directly via `supabaseServer()` in the layout (a
  display-only read of Foundation-owned, RLS-protected tables, not a
  mutation or new business rule) rather than adding a new function to
  Foundation's own module uninvited.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-01.2** — `modules/ui/Nav.tsx`: static rail at the `lg`
  breakpoint (1024px, matching the backlog's suggested default), a
  hamburger-triggered overlay drawer below it. No horizontal page-body
  scroll — verified via `npm run build` + live route smoke test (below);
  full manual verification at all six named widths
  (`docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md` §32: 1440/1280/1024/768/390/375)
  was **not** performed with actual browser screenshots this session — see
  "Not done" below.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-01.3** — `modules/ui/States.tsx`: `EmptyState`,
  `ErrorState`, `NotYetAvailable`, and three skeleton shapes
  (`CardGridSkeleton`, `TableSkeleton`, `DetailSkeleton`) matching the
  dashboard/table/detail-page layouts. Applied to the Overview dashboard,
  new Risk/Runtime index pages, and the `/reports`/`/settings`
  not-yet-available placeholders; **not yet retrofitted** into every
  existing domain module's own bare pages (agents, access, compliance,
  policies, integrations) — see "Not done" below.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-02.1** — Overview dashboard (`app/(customer)/page.tsx`):
  all nine PRD cards, each a real query — Total/Active Agents (Identity's
  `listAgents`), Unowned (Identity's `getOwnershipIssues`, fanned out in
  parallel per agent — Identity publishes no bulk "agents with ownership
  issues" query, so this is `Promise.all`, not a sequential loop, per
  CLAUDE.md §15; flagged as not scaling past a small fixture set without
  a bulk contract from Identity), Certification Overdue (Compliance's
  `listCampaigns`/`listCampaignItems`, filtered on `dueDate` in the past
  and `status: 'pending'`), High/Critical Risk and Policy/Access
  Violations (Risk's `getFindings(tenantId, {status:'open'})` — a single
  tenant-wide call, not agent-scoped, so no N+1 there), Rogue/Restricted
  (Identity's `lifecycleState === 'RESTRICTED'`, since Risk Agent's own
  auto-restriction on a CRITICAL finding is exactly this build's "rogue"
  signal), Excessive Access (distinct agent count from Risk's
  `excessive_access`-category open findings). Every card fetched in
  parallel (`Promise.all`), per CLAUDE.md §15 — no sequential waterfall.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-02.2** — `RiskTrendChart` (recharts horizontal bar,
  severity-colored, tenant-wide open-finding counts) plus a real action
  queue (active campaigns needing review + open high/critical findings,
  each linking to the actual record) on the Overview dashboard.

**Verification run:**
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` (after clearing a stale
  `.next/types` cache left over from the `git mv` restructuring — a false
  positive, not a real error), `npm run build` — all clean, all 36+
  routes present at their original URLs.
- `npm run test` — 53/53 (no new unit tests this story; nothing added is
  algorithmically complex enough to warrant one — the dashboard's
  aggregation logic is straightforward filtering/counting over already-
  tested module outputs).
- Live smoke test against a locally started production server:
  unauthenticated hits to all ten customer routes (`/`, `/agents`,
  `/access`, `/risk`, `/runtime`, `/compliance/campaigns`, `/policies`,
  `/integrations`, `/reports`, `/settings`) all correctly return
  307-to-`/sign-in` (checked proactively — this caught the `/risk`/
  `/runtime` 404 gap above, fixed, then re-verified clean).

**Not done this session, honestly flagged rather than silently claimed:**
- **No authenticated, real-browser visual verification** — the pre-commit
  design-review checklist (`docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md` §32:
  visual hierarchy, all six named responsive widths, both themes, every
  interaction state, realistic data) was **not** run against an actual
  rendered, signed-in session. This sandbox's fixture users are
  SQL-inserted `auth.users` rows with no real password, and this
  sandbox's network egress to Supabase is blocked outside the Supabase
  MCP tool (an established constraint every module this session has
  worked around for database access, but which also blocks establishing
  a real GoTrue browser session for Playwright). Crafting a synthetic
  `encrypted_password`/session directly in `auth.users` was considered
  and rejected as too fragile/invasive for a one-off visual check.
  **This is the single largest gap in this story** — a real visual pass
  (ideally once deployed, or by the user running `npm run dev` locally
  and signing in) is needed before EXPERIENCE-P0-01/02 can be marked
  fully `Done` rather than `Partial`.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-03 (domain screens) is largely not done.** Only two new
  thin index pages were added (Risk, Runtime, both listed above). Every
  other domain module's existing bare functional page (Identity's
  `/agents`/`/agents/:id`, Access's `/access`/`/access/requests`/
  `/access/agents/:id`, Compliance's `/compliance/campaigns`/`/compliance/
  campaigns/:id`, `/policies`/`/policies/:id`, Integration's
  `/integrations`/`/integrations/:id`/`/integrations/new`) still renders
  with its original inline-style markup from its own module's session —
  functional, but not restyled with `modules/ui/*` or brought in line with
  `docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md`. They now inherit the new shell
  (top bar, nav, theme) since they moved under `(customer)/`, but their
  own content is unchanged. The PRD's specific worked layouts (Agent
  Detail's tab structure, Agent Risk Page, Rogue Agent Detail — backlog
  §35-37) were **not** implemented — this is real, substantial remaining
  work, not a minor gap.
- Given the scope of restyling every domain screen to the full standard
  `docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md` sets (tabs, tables with search/
  filter/sort/pagination/density controls, drawers for contextual detail,
  etc.) is, realistically, comparable in size to several of the domain
  modules' own full builds, completing it was not achievable in this
  session alongside the rest of this session's other module work. This is
  recorded as substantial remaining Experience Agent work, not deferred to
  P1 — none of it is listed in the backlog's own P1 section.

**Dependencies consumed:** Foundation's `getTenantContext()`,
`requirePermission()`, `supabaseServer()`; Identity's `listAgents()`,
`getOwnershipIssues()`; Access's own existing pages (composed via the new
shell, not modified); Risk's `getFindings()`; Compliance's `listCampaigns()`/
`listCampaignItems()` — all used exactly as published, no modification to
any other module's service files.

**Published this session:** `modules/ui/*` (`Badge`, `Card`, `Button`,
`Table`, `States`, `Nav`, `UserMenu`, `theme`, `RiskTrendChart`, barrel
`index.ts`) — the shared design-system layer every other module's future
UI work should consume, per CLAUDE.md §13's ownership rule.

## 2026-09-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-04, EXPERIENCE-P0-05, EXPERIENCE-P0-06, EXPERIENCE-P0-07, EXPERIENCE-P0-08 (2026-09-14 requirements refresh)

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.
Per the user's explicit "continue automatically" instruction, picked up the
five Not Started rows the requirements-refresh pass added to this
backlog's Progress Tracker, auto-chained from Compliance Agent.

**Built:**

- **EXPERIENCE-P0-04 — Action Safety.** New `modules/ui/ConfirmAction.tsx`:
  `ConfirmActionDialog` (Radix Dialog-based) renders a title/description,
  an optional scope preview, an optional required-reason field, a
  disabled+"Working…" in-flight state that blocks Escape/overlay-dismiss
  while busy (so a click can't be lost mid-action), and a result panel
  supporting both a single-action outcome and a per-item bulk-action
  breakdown (`N of M succeeded`, failed items listed with their own
  error). This is presentation only — `onConfirm` is supplied by the
  calling domain module and is the only place an authorization decision
  is made, per non-negotiable #15; the component never decides whether an
  action is allowed. Wired to a real consumer: the Risk Findings page's
  "Request remediation" button now goes through
  `RemediateFindingButton` (`app/(customer)/risk/agents/[agentId]/
  RemediateFindingButton.tsx`), calling Risk Agent's existing
  `POST /api/v1/findings/:id/remediate` (unmodified) instead of the old
  plain `<form action>` — chosen over the server-action version
  specifically because the server action calls `redirect()`, which would
  never let a result panel render; the API route returns real JSON so the
  confirm→in-flight→result flow is provably real, not just plumbed.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-05 — Accessibility Foundation.** Global
  `:focus-visible` outline (accent-colored, 2px, in `app/globals.css`) as
  a catch-all beneath per-component `focus-visible:outline` classes added
  to every new/touched interactive element (nav links, buttons, table
  sort headers, table/card rows, dialog close buttons, filter/search
  inputs). A skip-to-content link was added to the customer shell
  (`app/(customer)/layout.tsx`), landing on a new `id="main-content"` on
  `<main>`. `Nav.tsx`'s mobile drawer was rebuilt on
  `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (previously a plain overlay `<div>` with no
  focus trap or Escape-to-close) so it inherits Radix's real focus-trap/
  `aria-modal`/Escape behavior; nav links gained `aria-current="page"` for
  the active route. `DataTable`'s sortable headers put `aria-sort` on the
  `<th>` itself (not the inner `<button>`, which isn't a valid ARIA host
  for that attribute — caught by `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` during this
  story's own lint pass, fixed by extending `Th` to accept arbitrary
  `<th>` attributes). Badges/severity indicators already carried a text
  label alongside color (pre-existing from EXPERIENCE-P0-01, unchanged).
  **Not done**: a full WCAG AA contrast-ratio audit of every token pair in
  both themes (spot-checked the highest-traffic pairs — text-primary/
  background, text-secondary/background, accent/background — by reading
  the palette, not with a contrast-ratio tool); retrofitting these
  patterns onto every pre-existing bare domain page (the same large,
  already-flagged EXPERIENCE-P0-03 gap).
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-06 — Evidence Drawer & Investigation Deep Links.** New
  `modules/ui/Drawer.tsx`: `EvidenceDrawer` (a Radix Dialog-based side
  panel, not a new library) and `useEvidenceDrawerParam(paramName)`, a
  hook that reads/writes one query-string param (default `evidence`)
  while leaving every other param — a list's filters, sort, page —
  untouched, so a drawer's URL is shareable and restores the exact same
  investigation context on reload. Wired to a real consumer: the Risk
  Findings page's new "View evidence" button
  (`FindingEvidenceTrigger`/`FindingEvidenceDrawer` in
  `app/(customer)/risk/agents/[agentId]/FindingEvidenceDrawer.tsx`) opens
  `?evidence=<findingId>`, fetches that finding's full evidence via
  Risk's existing `GET /api/v1/findings/:id` (unmodified), and renders it
  without navigating away from the findings list. Guards against showing
  a stale finding's evidence mid-navigation (tracks that the loaded
  detail's `id` still matches the current `findingId` before rendering it
  — the more idiomatic fix, once a first draft that called `setState`
  synchronously in the effect body was caught by
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` during this story's own lint pass).
  **Not done**: consumption by Access's access-path detail, Runtime's
  event detail, or Compliance's certification evidence — only Risk's
  finding evidence is wired this session.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-07 — Shell Global Search & Notifications.** New
  `modules/ui/ShellSearchAndNotifications.tsx`: `ShellGlobalSearch` (a
  Radix Dialog search entry point) and `ShellNotifications` (a Radix
  DropdownMenu bell icon), both composed into the shell's top bar
  (`app/(customer)/layout.tsx`, next to the existing tenant switcher/user
  menu). Operations Agent (module 10) owns search/notifications data and
  matching logic and is still dormant as of this story — both render the
  existing `NotYetAvailable` placeholder (the same pattern already used
  elsewhere in this backlog for a not-yet-available dependency) rather
  than inventing search results or notification data. Marked `Done`
  rather than `Partial`: the story's own acceptance is explicitly "a
  top-bar search entry point and a notifications indicator/panel... a
  'Not yet available' placeholder until then" — which is exactly what was
  built.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-08 — Data Table Primitive.** New
  `modules/ui/DataTable.tsx`: `useTableState(paramPrefix, defaults)`
  manages `page`/`pageSize`/`sortKey`/`sortDir`/`filter` as URL query
  params namespaced by `paramPrefix` (so more than one table can live on
  one page without colliding), and `DataTable` renders a filter input,
  sortable column headers, a real `<table>` at `sm`+ widths, a labelled
  key/value card list below `sm` (the responsive card-transform — never
  just a shrunk table, per `docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md`'s
  per-breakpoint guidance), and Previous/Next pagination controls. The
  primitive itself only manages *state* — the calling Server Component
  page is responsible for the actual `limit`/`offset` query, per
  CLAUDE.md §15. Wired to a real consumer: the Agent Inventory page
  (`app/(customer)/agents/AgentsTable.tsx`) replaces its old raw
  `<table>`. **Flagged, not silently assumed**: Identity Agent's
  `listAgents()` has no pagination/sort parameters of its own, so this
  consumer sorts/filters/paginates the already-fetched full agent list
  client-side rather than at the database layer — a documented stopgap
  (this is a UI-only change to a module Experience Agent doesn't own the
  service layer of, per non-negotiable #18; the real fix is Identity
  Agent publishing a paginated `listAgents()` variant) rather than a
  limitation of the `DataTable` primitive itself, which is built to
  consume server-driven pagination the moment a page's own query supports
  it.

**Verification run:**
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` — both clean after two real fixes
  caught by lint itself (not just formatting): `DataTable`'s misplaced
  `aria-sort` (EXPERIENCE-P0-05 above) and `FindingEvidenceDrawer`'s
  synchronous `setState` in an effect body (EXPERIENCE-P0-06 above).
- `npm run build` — clean; the three new API routes this story's
  consumers call already existed (Risk's remediate/findings-by-id
  routes) or were Compliance Agent's own prior-session additions — no new
  routes were added by Experience Agent itself, consistent with owning no
  database tables or API routes per the ownership map.
- `npx vitest run` — 128/128 passing (no regressions; no new unit tests
  added — this module's presentation components have never carried a
  jsdom-based component-test harness, consistent with the rest of this
  backlog's established verification approach of live/browser checks
  instead for UI).
- `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match (unchanged
  from every prior check this session).
- Live smoke test against a locally built production server
  (`npm run start`): unauthenticated `GET` to `/agents`, `/risk/agents/
  :id`, and `/` all correctly 307-redirect to `/sign-in`; `/sign-in`
  itself returns 200. **Not done**: authenticated, interactive real-
  browser verification of the new primitives themselves (opening
  `ConfirmActionDialog`, confirming an action and reading the result
  panel; opening `EvidenceDrawer` via the URL param and confirming it
  restores on reload; exercising `DataTable`'s sort/filter/pagination
  controls; tabbing through focus order) — this sandbox has no seeded
  authenticated session/credentials to drive a real login, the same
  constraint already recorded against EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2 in the
  entry above. This is the same category of gap, not a new one, and is
  the reason every new/changed story here is `Partial` rather than
  `Done` (except EXPERIENCE-P0-07, whose entire acceptance criterion is
  the placeholder itself).

**Not started this session / still open:**
- Every gap already recorded in the entry above (EXPERIENCE-P0-01
  through 03) is unchanged and carries forward.
- None of this session's five new primitives have been retrofitted onto
  every domain screen yet — only one real consumer each (proving the
  primitive works, not a full rollout). Rolling `DataTable`/
  `ConfirmActionDialog`/`EvidenceDrawer` out to Access/Runtime/
  Compliance/Integration's own bare pages is exactly the same scope as
  the already-flagged EXPERIENCE-P0-03 gap and is not attempted here.
- A real contrast-ratio audit tool was not run against the token palette.

**Dependencies consumed:** everything from the prior entry, plus Risk
Agent's `GET /api/v1/findings/:id` and `POST /api/v1/findings/:id/
remediate` (both pre-existing, unmodified — read/called exactly as
published, no changes to any Risk Agent file).

**Published this session:** `ConfirmActionDialog`, `EvidenceDrawer`,
`useEvidenceDrawerParam`, `ShellGlobalSearch`, `ShellNotifications`,
`DataTable`, `useTableState`, `useClientFilteredRows` (all exported from
`modules/ui/index.ts`) — the shared primitives every other module's UI
work should consume from here on, per CLAUDE.md §13.

## 2026-09-14 — Backlog reconciliation: `08_UI_UX.md` §38 Locked Design
System addendum (no code changed)

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

The user separately uploaded a more detailed module-08 requirements
document (`08_UI_UX.md`) and asked for the backlog to be updated. This
entry documents that reconciliation; no implementation work was done —
`docs/plan/08-EXPERIENCE-AGENT-BACKLOG.md` was the only file touched.

**What was found:** the uploaded document's early sections (§5, §6,
§33-37, UX-P0-01 through UX-P0-12, UX-P1-01 through 04, UX-P2-01 through
03) are content-identical to what was already reconciled into the
backlog's existing "Requirements Refresh — 2026-09-14" section earlier
in this build. The genuinely new material is §38, "Locked Product Design
System — P0" (UX-P0-13 through UX-P0-25), plus UX-P1-05/06.

**Why this wasn't implemented directly:** §38 specifies a concrete,
opinionated redesign of the shell/token/navigation/button layer itself —
not new acceptance detail for screens this module already owns, but a
different technology and structure for work already `Done`/`Partial`
and load-bearing across every module built this session:

- shadcn/ui-on-Radix + `class-variance-authority` as the component-variant
  technology (vs. the hand-rolled `modules/ui/*` pattern already shipped);
- OKLCH color tokens under a different semantic naming scheme, with dark
  mode demoted from mandatory to optional for the current release (vs.
  the already-shipped `background`/`surface`/`surface-elevated`/`border`/
  `text-primary/secondary/muted`/`accent`/`success`/`warning`/`danger`/
  `info` tokens, consumed via Tailwind classes across dozens of files
  from every module, with both light and dark mode already implemented
  per `CLAUDE.md` §13's mandatory requirement);
- a topbar restructure (no avatar; tenant switcher moved into the left
  group) and an account-menu relocation (bottom-left of the nav drawer,
  different item list) vs. the already-`Done`, already-mounted
  EXPERIENCE-P0-01.1 shell every route renders inside today;
- **left navigation required to be a slide-in overlay drawer at every
  width, never a permanently docked rail** — this directly contradicts
  EXPERIENCE-P0-01.2's already-shipped desktop-docked-rail behavior and
  is the highest-impact single conflict, since it changes the navigation
  model for the entire product;
- a narrower, differently-named button-variant set (default/outline/
  secondary/ghost/destructive/link), coupled to the shadcn/CVA question
  above.

Per `CLAUDE.md` §4's stop-and-report rule and non-negotiable #18 (a
module must not silently rework its own already-shipped, widely-
depended-upon surface without the ambiguity being a real architecture
decision — reworking it now would touch every consumer across every
module built this session, and downgrading dark mode would regress
`CLAUDE.md` §13), this was **flagged, not implemented**: a single new
Progress Tracker row, `EXPERIENCE-P0-09` ("Locked Product Design System
v2"), status "Not Started — flagged, not implemented," with the specific
open questions listed in the backlog's new "Requirements Refresh —
2026-09-14 (Locked Design System addendum)" section (component-variant
technology choice and migration strategy; OKLCH re-key and dark-mode
mandate; drawer-only vs. docked-rail navigation; topbar/account-menu
restructure).

**What needed no new row:** UX-P0-19 (page composition), UX-P0-21
(status/risk never color-only), UX-P0-23 (dashboard card affordance) and
UX-P0-24 (destructive-action separation) are already-required behavior
folded into EXPERIENCE-P0-03/04/05's existing acceptance bar. UX-P0-20
(sortable/filterable/paginated tables) is essentially already satisfied
by this session's `DataTable` primitive (EXPERIENCE-P0-08, `Partial`).
UX-P0-22 (inline-editable rows) was added as acceptance detail on
EXPERIENCE-P0-08/03 rather than a new story. UX-P1-05 (component
inventory) and UX-P1-06 (visual regression/responsive QA harness) were
appended to the existing P1 list, with UX-P1-05 noted as depending on
EXPERIENCE-P0-09 being resolved first (cataloging a component set that
may still change is wasted work).

**Also fixed in this pass:** the backlog's existing "Requirements
Refresh — 2026-09-14" prose for EXPERIENCE-P0-04 through 08 still read
"Not started" from when those rows were first proposed, even though the
Progress Tracker table (and this audit log's prior entries) already show
them `Partial`/`Done` from actual work completed earlier this session.
Updated each story's prose to match the Progress Tracker so the document
is internally consistent.

**Not a code change:** no `modules/ui/*`, `app/(customer)/*`, or
migration file was touched. `docs/plan/08-EXPERIENCE-AGENT-BACKLOG.md`
is the only file modified in this entry.

**Open question for the user:** whether and how to adopt `08_UI_UX.md`
§38 (EXPERIENCE-P0-09) — see the four numbered questions in the backlog's
new addendum section. Until answered, this module continues operating
on its existing, already-shipped shell/token/navigation implementation
for any further work.

## 2026-09-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-03: the Agent Detail worked layout (Overview/
Access/Runtime/Risk tabs)

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

Picked up the single largest documented gap in EXPERIENCE-P0-03: the PRD's
specific worked layouts for Agent Detail and the Agent Risk Page. Four
separate routes already existed as real, functional, but visually bare
pages, each owned by its own domain module's data contract per
`docs/design/ownership-map.md` — `/agents/:id` (Identity), `/access/agents/
:id` (Access), `/runtime/agents/:id` (Runtime), `/risk/agents/:id` (Risk).
Rather than merging four separately-permissioned, separately-owned routes
into one giant page (which would duplicate a large amount of interactive
form logic and break each route's own Suspense/perf boundary), built a new
shared `modules/ui/AgentTabs.tsx` primitive — a styled sub-navigation bar
(real `<Link>`s with `aria-current="page"`, not an ARIA tablist, since this
is full-page navigation across separately-owned routes, not client-side
tab-panel switching) that appears identically on all four pages, turning
them into one coherent Agent Detail experience without changing any
route's ownership or data-fetching.

**Built:**

- `modules/ui/AgentTabs.tsx` (new, exported from `modules/ui/index.ts`) —
  Overview / Access (CAN) / Runtime (DID) / Risk & Findings tabs.
- `app/(customer)/agents/[id]/page.tsx` restyled: header with lifecycle-
  state and criticality badges (`Badge`/`SeverityBadge`), `AgentTabs`, and
  every existing section (Lifecycle, Owners, Contract/SHOULD, Relationships,
  Linked Identities) rebuilt on `Card`/`CardHeader`/`CardBody` with real
  form styling — same server actions, same data, no behavior change.
- `app/(customer)/access/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx` restyled onto
  `Card`/`TableContainer`/`Badge` — effective access is now a real table,
  policy evaluation results show a pass/violation/exempted badge (the real
  `PolicyEvaluationResult` union, not a guessed pass/fail one).
- `app/(customer)/runtime/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx` restyled — the
  SHOULD/CAN/DID comparison (CLAUDE.md §9's canonical model) is now the
  page's lead card with an explicit Healthy/Deviation/SHOULD-undefined
  badge and a tone-mapped badge per `ComparisonOutcomeType` (danger for
  excessive_access/unexpected_capability/behavioral_violation, warning for
  insufficient_access/unused_capability, neutral for unscored_unknown, per
  RUNTIME-P0-14's own "never silently scored" rule); DID activity and
  recent events are now real tables.
- `app/(customer)/risk/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx` restyled onto
  `Card`/`SeverityBadge` — each finding is now a card with severity/
  category/status badges up front; the existing `ConfirmActionDialog`
  (`RemediateFindingButton`) and `EvidenceDrawer`
  (`FindingEvidenceDrawer`/`FindingEvidenceTrigger`) consumers from the
  earlier EXPERIENCE-P0-04/06 dispatch were left untouched (already real
  primitives) and are now visually integrated rather than sitting inside
  unstyled `<section>` markup.

No domain module's service function, API route, server action, or data
shape was touched — every change is presentation-layer only inside
`app/(customer)/*` page files and one new `modules/ui/*` primitive,
consistent with this module's "owns UI composition, not data" scope.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run`
(139/139 passing, unchanged — no test touches page components), `npm run
build` with `.next` deleted first (cold-cache build, all four routes
compile) — all green. `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` —
no match. Live smoke test against a locally built production server (port
3102, torn down after): all four restyled routes correctly 307-redirect
unauthenticated requests to `/sign-in` — no regression in the auth
boundary from the rewrite.

**Not done this pass** (same category of gap as before, not new):
authenticated real-browser visual verification (light/dark mode, all seven
named breakpoints) — same sandbox constraint recorded against
EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2 throughout this session, not re-litigated here.
The Rogue Agent Detail worked layout (PRD §37) is a distinct view from the
four tabs built here (a rogue-specific investigation surface, not just the
Risk tab) and was not attempted this pass. Access/Compliance/Integration/
Foundation's own list and settings pages (`/access`, `/compliance/
campaigns`, `/integrations`, `/settings/*`) remain bare and unrestyled —
EXPERIENCE-P0-03's Progress Tracker note now reflects exactly this
narrower remaining scope rather than the previous, broader "every other
domain module's existing bare page" description.

**Open questions:** none new. EXPERIENCE-P0-09 (the `08_UI_UX.md` §38
addendum) remains open from the prior entry and was not touched or
implicated by this dispatch — `AgentTabs` and the restyled pages use the
existing, already-shipped token/nav system, not anything from that
addendum.

## 2026-09-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-09: Locked Product Design System v2, adopted
in full by explicit user decision

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

The user asked to "run the Experience backlog and ensure all the stories
are completed." EXPERIENCE-P0-09 was the one story genuinely blocked on a
user decision (not a technical gap) — before touching it, the user was
asked directly (via a single bundled question covering all four numbered
sub-decisions from the prior entry: component-variant technology, OKLCH
token re-key and the dark-mode question, drawer-only vs. docked-rail
navigation, topbar/account-menu restructure) and chose **"Adopt it
fully."** This entry is the full implementation record.

**Scope of "fully":** every piece of §38 that materially conflicted with
already-shipped work (UX-P0-13 through UX-P0-18) was implemented. One
deliberate, disclosed exception: **dark mode was kept**, re-implemented in
OKLCH under the new token names rather than demoted to unsupported/
light-only. Reasoning: `CLAUDE.md` §13 makes dark mode a binding,
independent Definition-of-Done requirement (part of the Locked
Architecture the root contract protects), and the specific decision put to
the user was about design-system technology/naming/navigation/topbar
structure — not a request to repeal an unrelated non-negotiable. Silently
dropping dark mode under the banner of "the user said adopt fully" would
have been inferring a non-negotiable-repeal from a UI-technology question,
which `CLAUDE.md` §1's own text (non-negotiables changeable only by
explicit approval, not "an agent's own judgment call") argues directly
against. If the user did intend to drop dark-mode support, that is a
one-line follow-up instruction away and cheap to act on from here.

**Built:**

- **Token layer (`app/globals.css`):** every CSS custom property re-keyed
  to `oklch()` values under shadcn/ui's own canonical naming —
  `background`/`foreground`, `card`/`card-foreground`, `popover`/
  `popover-foreground`, `primary`/`primary-foreground`, `secondary`/
  `secondary-foreground`, `muted`/`muted-foreground`, `accent`/
  `accent-foreground`, `destructive`/`destructive-foreground`, `border`/
  `input`/`ring`, plus `success`/`warning`/`info` kept as WonderAgent-
  specific extensions (shadcn ships no default for these — risk/status
  severity is this product's own vocabulary, not shadcn's). Both light and
  dark palettes fully re-derived in OKLCH, same three-way resolution
  mechanism as before (`prefers-color-scheme` default + explicit
  `data-theme` override, both directions). `--radius` is now a single
  shadcn-style base value with `calc()`-derived `sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` steps.
- **Component technology (`lib/utils.ts`, new):** the standard shadcn `cn()`
  helper (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`, both added as dependencies alongside
  the already-present `class-variance-authority`... — correction:
  `class-variance-authority` and `tailwind-merge` were newly added this
  session, `clsx` was already a dependency).
- **`modules/ui/Button.tsx`** rebuilt on `cva()` with the exact shadcn
  variant set UX-P0-18 specifies — `default`/`outline`/`secondary`/
  `ghost`/`destructive`/`link` — plus a `size` axis (`default`/`sm`/`lg`).
  Checked before rewriting: every one of the 19 existing `<Button>`/
  `<LinkButton>` call sites across the codebase already passed an explicit
  `variant` prop (none relied on the old implicit default), and all
  19 use `secondary`/`ghost`/`destructive` — names that are unchanged in
  the new set — so **zero call sites needed updating** despite the
  default variant itself changing from the old `secondary` to the new
  `default`.
- **`modules/ui/Badge.tsx`** rebuilt on `cva()` but keeps its own
  `BadgeTone` vocabulary (`neutral`/`success`/`warning`/`danger`/`info`/
  `accent`) rather than adopting shadcn's default badge variants — this is
  WonderAgent's own risk/severity domain language (CLAUDE.md §9), not a
  shadcn concept, so "adopt shadcn as the component *technology*" was
  applied without discarding the product's own semantic vocabulary.
  `danger` now maps to the `destructive` token internally.
- **`modules/ui/Card.tsx`, `Table.tsx`, `States.tsx`** re-themed onto the
  new tokens (`bg-card`/`text-card-foreground`, `bg-muted`, etc.), same
  props/behavior.
- **`modules/ui/Nav.tsx`** rewritten per UX-P0-16: the left navigation is
  now a slide-in overlay drawer **at every width** — the previous
  `lg:block` static desktop rail is gone entirely. A single menu-trigger
  button renders inline wherever `<Nav>` is placed (now the topbar's left
  group) rather than a viewport-conditional floating button. `Nav` gained
  a `footer` slot for the account panel.
- **`modules/ui/UserMenu.tsx` → `modules/ui/AccountPanel.tsx`** (renamed,
  one consumer, git-mv'd): no longer a topbar `DropdownMenu` — per
  UX-P0-17, it's now plain inline content (theme toggle, tenant switcher,
  sign out) rendered as `<Nav>`'s `footer`, pinned to the bottom of the
  drawer. No avatar circle (UX-P0-15).
- **`app/(customer)/layout.tsx`** restructured: topbar left group is now
  menu-trigger + logo + current tenant name (no separate tenant-switcher
  control — switching lives in the drawer's `AccountPanel`); right group
  is search + notifications only, no user avatar/menu. The page shell
  changed from a side-by-side flex (docked nav + content) to a stacked
  flex-column (full-width topbar, full-width content below), the correct
  structural consequence of removing the docked rail.
- **`modules/ui/ConfirmAction.tsx`, `Drawer.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`,
  `RiskTrendChart.tsx`, `ShellSearchAndNotifications.tsx`,
  `AgentTabs.tsx`, `theme.tsx`** — every old token class name (`bg-surface`,
  `bg-surface-elevated`, `text-text-primary/secondary/muted`, `text-danger`,
  `bg-danger`, `outline-accent`) replaced with its new-scheme equivalent,
  context-aware (floating panels → `bg-popover`; page-level cards →
  `bg-card`; plain inputs/topbar buttons → `bg-background`; hover
  highlights → `bg-accent`/`text-accent-foreground`; strong
  active/selected indicators, which needed the *old* meaning of "accent"
  as a brand color → `bg-primary`/`text-primary`, since the *new* `accent`
  token means something different in shadcn's scheme, a subtle
  hover/highlight background, not the primary brand color). `RiskTrendChart`'s
  hardcoded hex severity colors were replaced with `var(--color-*)`
  references into the new token set instead (works directly in Recharts'
  SVG `fill`/`stroke` props).
- **12 `app/(customer)/*` page files** (every file directly referencing
  old utility classes rather than going through `modules/ui/*`) updated
  the same way: `agents/[id]`, `access/agents/[agentId]`,
  `risk/agents/[agentId]` (+ `FindingEvidenceDrawer.tsx`),
  `runtime/agents/[agentId]`, `risk`, `runtime`, the dashboard (`page.tsx`),
  `settings`, `settings/roles`, `settings/sso`, `settings/security`. One
  real bug caught and fixed during this pass: a bulk find/replace's word-
  boundary match briefly turned `text-accent-foreground` into
  `text-primary-foreground` inside `settings/sso/page.tsx` while leaving
  its paired `bg-accent` untouched, producing a broken
  bg-accent/text-primary-foreground pairing (illegible contrast) — caught
  by a full re-grep pass across every remaining `accent`/`primary`
  reference before verification, not by chance.
- **`CLAUDE.md` §2 and §13**, **`docs/design/UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md` §4**
  updated to name the new token scheme in place of the original hex-token
  names, since both documents quote the specific token names directly and
  leaving them stale would mislead every future agent reading the binding
  contract. (§7 Navigation and §3 Responsive Design were checked and do
  **not** make a specific "docked desktop rail" claim, so needed no edit;
  a full line-by-line audit of the design rules document's other ~30
  sections for consistency was not attempted this pass.)

**Verification:**

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run` (139/139 passing,
  unchanged), `npm run build` with `.next` deleted first (cold-cache
  build, every route compiles) — all green.
- `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match.
- Live smoke test against a locally built production server (port 3103,
  torn down after): every existing authenticated route (`/`, `/agents`,
  the four agent-detail tabs, `/settings*`) still correctly 307-redirects
  unauthenticated requests to `/sign-in` — no auth-boundary regression
  from the rewrite.
- **Real-browser visual verification, genuinely attempted this pass** (not
  just asserted as a sandbox constraint): this environment ships a
  pre-installed Chromium and a global `playwright` CLI (v1.56.1). Used it
  to screenshot the public `/sign-in` page (the only pre-auth page, not
  itself restyled by Experience Agent — it is Foundation Agent's bare
  page, out of EXPERIENCE-P0-03's scope) at 1440×900 light, 1440×900 dark,
  and 390×844 (mobile). All three confirm: the OKLCH token pipeline
  resolves correctly end-to-end in a real browser (light = light gray
  background/near-black text; dark = near-black background/light text,
  matching the intended palette, not a broken/transparent render), and no
  horizontal overflow at 390px width.
- **Authenticated in-app screenshots were also genuinely attempted, not
  just assumed blocked:** wrote a real Playwright script that filled and
  submitted the `/sign-up` form (email/password) against the running
  server. Result: `Unexpected token 'H', "Host not i"... is not valid
  JSON` — the app server's own outbound call to Supabase Auth was
  rejected by this sandbox's network egress policy (an HTML "Host not in
  allowlist"-style error page returned where JSON was expected), not a
  missing-test-user problem. This is a materially stronger, more precise
  finding than this session's prior repeated assertion of "sandbox
  constraint, no seeded session" — it confirms the constraint is network-
  level and applies to the *application's own* runtime, not just this
  agent's tooling. Recorded here so a future non-sandboxed verification
  pass knows exactly what blocked it here and doesn't need to re-diagnose.

**Not done this pass:** authenticated real-browser screenshots (blocked as
above, not a choice); a full design-system component inventory (UX-P1-05,
already noted as depending on this exact decision being resolved — now
unblocked, but not built this pass); the visual-regression/responsive QA
harness (UX-P1-06); retrofitting `ConfirmActionDialog`/`EvidenceDrawer`/
`DataTable` onto more domain screens (EXPERIENCE-P0-04/06/08's existing,
unchanged gaps — this dispatch re-themed every existing consumer, it did
not add new ones); the Rogue Agent Detail worked layout and the remaining
bare Access/Compliance/Integration list pages (EXPERIENCE-P0-03's existing
gap, unchanged by this dispatch).

**Not a decision made unilaterally beyond what was asked:** the dark-mode-
kept deviation above is the only place this dispatch deliberately diverged
from a literal reading of "adopt it fully," and it's disclosed with
reasoning rather than silently done either way. Everything else in §38's
conflicting-item list (UX-P0-13 through UX-P0-18) was implemented as
specified.

## 2026-09-14 — "Keep going till all Experience backlog stories are
complete": bare-page rollout, Action Safety/Evidence Drawer retrofits, a
real contrast audit, and the Rogue Agent Detail layout

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

The user asked to keep going until every Experience story is `Done`.
Worked through every remaining documented gap in priority order: the
17 still-bare pages (EXPERIENCE-P0-03), the shell search/notifications
overclaim, Action Safety retrofits (EXPERIENCE-P0-04), a real contrast
audit and fixes (EXPERIENCE-P0-05), Evidence Drawer retrofits
(EXPERIENCE-P0-06), further `DataTable` rollout (EXPERIENCE-P0-08), and
the PRD §37 Rogue Agent Detail worked layout (the last piece of
EXPERIENCE-P0-03). This entry covers three commits worth of work in this
same dispatch (`6744f85`, the evidence/contrast/rogue-agent commit that
follows, and this entry covering both).

**Every remaining bare page restyled (EXPERIENCE-P0-03):** all 17 pages
found by a repo-wide grep for pages not using `Card`/`DataTable`/
`TableContainer` — Access (applications list, requests), Policies (list,
detail), Compliance campaigns (list, detail), Integrations (list, new,
detail), Audit, Search, Reports (list, detail), Settings/notifications,
and Identity's Agents new/discovery/duplicates screens. A repo-wide
re-grep after the pass confirms zero bare pages remain under
`app/(customer)/*`.

**New shared primitives to support the rollout:**
- `modules/ui/Field.tsx` (`TextField`/`SelectField`/`TextareaField`) — one
  consistent labeled-input treatment instead of every page hand-rolling
  its own `inputClass`/`labelClass` strings, which is what every prior
  bare page had been doing independently.
- `modules/ui/DataTable.tsx` gained `SimpleDataTable`, generalizing the
  client-side sort/filter/paginate-over-an-already-fetched-list pattern
  `AgentsTable` established, now also consumed by Access's Applications
  table and the Policies table.
- `app/(customer)/loading.tsx`/`error.tsx` — Next.js App Router segment-
  level fallbacks so every route under the shell gets a real skeleton
  (`DetailSkeleton`) and a designed, retry-able error state
  (`ErrorState` + a `reset()`-bound retry button) for free, closing
  EXPERIENCE-P0-01.3's "not retrofitted everywhere" gap systemically
  rather than page-by-page.

**Action Safety retrofits (EXPERIENCE-P0-04), each wired to an existing
API route rather than a bare form-submit button:**
- Identity's duplicate-registration merge (`MergeDuplicateButton.tsx`) —
  discards a pending registration permanently, now confirmed via
  `ConfirmActionDialog` against `PATCH /api/v1/agents/duplicates/:id`.
- Compliance's certification "revoke" decision (`DecisionForm.tsx`) — the
  one decision type that really calls `revokeAccessGrant()` per
  Compliance's own audit log; every other decision (approve/modify/
  delegate/request_information) submits directly since they carry no
  equivalent irreversible consequence. Wired to the existing
  `POST /api/v1/compliance/items/:id/decisions` route.

**Evidence Drawer retrofits (EXPERIENCE-P0-06), each namespaced
(`useEvidenceDrawerParam(paramName)`) so more than one drawer can coexist
on a page without URL-param collisions:**
- Access — `AccessPathEvidenceDrawer.tsx`, composing Access Agent's
  `explainAccessPath()` via the existing `GET /api/v1/access/agents/:id/
  explain?resource=` route, deep-linkable via `?path=Application:
  Entitlement`.
- Runtime — `RuntimeEventEvidenceDrawer.tsx`, showing the full event
  record (source, outcome, tool, raw payload) for an already-loaded event
  row — no extra fetch needed since the events list is already fully
  loaded server-side; deep-linkable via `?event=<id>`.
- Compliance — `EvidenceDrawerClient.tsx` in the campaign detail page,
  showing the point-in-time `CertificationSnapshot` (COMPLIANCE-P0-03)
  a reviewer actually saw — agent contract version, access grant, policy
  evaluations at capture time — again from already-loaded data, deep-
  linkable via `?snapshot=<itemId>`.

**Corrected an overclaim (EXPERIENCE-P0-07):** the Progress Tracker
previously described `ShellGlobalSearch`/`ShellNotifications` as
"now compose Operations Agent's real `/api/v1/search` and
`/api/v1/notifications` endpoints," but the actual component code still
rendered the `NotYetAvailable` placeholder from before Operations Agent
existed — the doc update had outpaced the implementation. Fixed for real
this pass: `ShellGlobalSearch` is a debounced live search against
`/api/v1/search`, `ShellNotifications` fetches `/api/v1/notifications` on
open and calls `POST /api/v1/notifications/:id/read` on click, with an
unread-count badge on the bell icon.

**A real, computed WCAG contrast audit (EXPERIENCE-P0-05)** — not another
spot-check: `scripts/contrast-check.mjs` (new, committed to the repo for
reuse) implements the OKLCH→linear-sRGB→relative-luminance pipeline and
the WCAG contrast-ratio formula directly (no external library), and
checks every token pair actually used as text-on-background or
component-boundary-on-background across both themes. Found two real,
specific failures and fixed both in `app/globals.css`:
1. `success`/`warning` used as direct text-on-background (e.g. status
   messages) fell short of 4.5:1 in light mode (4.33:1 and 3.89:1
   respectively) — darkened both (`success` L 0.55→0.5, `warning` L
   0.6→0.55) to 5.28:1/4.78:1.
2. `input` (form-field border, a genuine WCAG 1.4.11 component-boundary
   case, distinct from `border`'s decorative card/table-divider use)
   was sharing `border`'s very subtle value (1.29:1/1.36:1 contrast) in
   both themes — split it into its own token and raised it to 3.48:1
   (light) / 3.30:1 (dark), both clearing the 3:1 component-boundary
   threshold. `border` itself was deliberately left as-is: WCAG 1.4.11
   doesn't require 3:1 for a purely decorative divider where the region
   is still distinguishable by background/spacing, which is the case for
   every card and table row in this codebase.
Every text pair now passes; re-verified via a real-browser screenshot of
the public `/sign-in` page after the change (light and dark) confirming
no visual regression, and the full pipeline (typecheck/lint/139 tests/
cold-cache build) stayed green throughout.

**The Rogue Agent Detail worked layout (PRD §37, EXPERIENCE-P0-03's last
open item):** built as `/risk/rogue` (an index of agents with open
rogue-category findings) and `/risk/rogue/:agentId` (the dedicated
investigation view) — deliberately distinct from the general per-agent
Risk tab (`/risk/agents/:id`), per the backlog's own framing of it as "a
rogue-specific investigation surface, not just the Risk tab." Leads with
*why* the agent is flagged (its rogue-category findings specifically),
the SHOULD/CAN/DID deviation behind them, and the ownership/
accountability chain — rather than a flat list of every finding of every
category. The rogue-category partition (`behavioral_deviation`,
`identity_anomaly`, `ownership_violation`, `lifecycle_violation`, as
distinct from the four access-violation categories) is not invented for
this screen — it's the exact same partition Operations Agent's
`generateRogueAgentReport()` already uses (`modules/operations/
reports.ts`), kept in sync rather than defining a second, possibly-
inconsistent notion of "rogue" for the UI.

**Verification (full pipeline run after every sub-batch, not just once at
the end):** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run`
(139/139 passing throughout — no test touches page components), `npm run
build` with `.next` deleted first — all green at each checkpoint.
`grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match, checked
after each build. Live smoke tests against locally built production
servers (torn down after each): every new/changed route (17 restyled
pages, the two new Rogue Agent routes) correctly 307-redirects
unauthenticated requests to `/sign-in` — no auth-boundary regression
anywhere in this large a change set. Two real bugs were caught and fixed
during this pass by the verification discipline itself, not luck: a
`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint error in `ShellGlobalSearch`
(fixed by deriving `displayResults` from render state instead of
resetting it synchronously in the effect) and the same class of bug in
`AccessPathEvidenceDrawer` (fixed by tracking `attemptedRef` instead of a
separate `loading` boolean set synchronously).

**Still not `Done` after this pass, honestly:**
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2** — authenticated real-browser visual
  verification remains blocked. This is not a re-assertion of the same
  claim as before: this pass got a precise, empirical confirmation (a
  real Playwright-driven sign-up attempt against the running app,
  documented in the prior entry) that this sandbox's network egress
  policy — confirmed directly via the agent proxy's own error message,
  "connect_rejected... organization policy," when curl was pointed at
  the Supabase project host — blocks the application's own server-side
  Supabase Auth calls. No further attempt was made to route around an
  explicit organizational network policy.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-04** — Action Safety now covers four real destructive
  actions across three modules, not every destructive action on every
  domain screen (e.g. Platform Agent's own tenant lifecycle actions,
  which are a separate authorization boundary Experience Agent doesn't
  compose per non-negotiable #3). Bulk-action reporting's per-item result
  panel still has no real bulk endpoint to prove itself against — none
  exists in this codebase yet.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-08** — `DataTable`/`SimpleDataTable` now has five real
  consumers (Agent Inventory, Applications, Policies, plus the two
  existing ones); Findings, Access Requests, Integrations, Compliance
  Items and Audit still use the plain `Table` primitive. All of these
  are smaller/less frequently very-large lists where a plain table is a
  reasonable choice, but a literal "DataTable is the standard for every
  list screen" reading of the story isn't fully satisfied.

**Open questions:** none new. EXPERIENCE-P0-09's dark-mode-kept deviation
from the prior entry remains the only outstanding disclosed decision
point.

---

## 2026-09-14 — One more increment: role-removal confirmation, three
more real `DataTable` consumers

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

A final push on the two stories still carrying a real, named gap after
the previous entry:

- **EXPERIENCE-P0-04** — `RemoveRoleButton.tsx` wraps Foundation's
  `removeRoleAction` (removing a role can lock someone out of the
  tenant) with `ConfirmActionDialog`, called directly as a Server Action
  from the Client Component rather than via a new API route — legitimate
  Next.js usage, and avoids Experience Agent creating a new
  Foundation-owned REST endpoint just to satisfy its own primitive's
  fetch-based calling convention. Safe here specifically because
  `removeRoleAction` only calls `revalidatePath()`, not `redirect()` —
  unlike the compliance decision flow earlier this session, there's no
  `NEXT_REDIRECT`-digest risk to work around.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-08** — `RiskAgentsTable.tsx` and `IntegrationsTable.tsx`
  (new) convert the Risk index and Integrations index from the plain
  `Table` primitive to `SimpleDataTable`, following the same pattern
  `ApplicationsTable`/`PoliciesTable` established.

Verified: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run`
(139/139), `npm run build` with `.next` deleted first — all green.
`grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match. Live smoke
test confirms `/risk`, `/integrations`, `/settings/roles` still correctly
redirect unauthenticated requests.

**Honest final state of this dispatch's two remaining-`Partial` stories**
(both genuinely improved, neither claimed as fully `Done`): EXPERIENCE-
P0-04 now has five real consumers across four modules rather than a
literal audit of every destructive action in the product (bulk-action
reporting still has no real bulk endpoint to test against; a few
narrower actions like direct access-grant revocation remain unconfirmed).
EXPERIENCE-P0-08 now has six real `DataTable`/`SimpleDataTable`
consumers; three more list screens (Access Requests, Compliance Items,
Audit) still use the plain `Table` primitive, a reasonable choice at
their current size but not literally every list screen in the product.
Both are recorded exactly this way in the Progress Tracker rather than
rounded up to `Done`.

**Everything else in the Experience backlog is now `Done`** except the
two items that are blocked by something outside this module's control
rather than remaining implementation work: EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2's
authenticated real-browser verification (this sandbox's network egress
policy, confirmed empirically this session — see the entry above) — and
these two, EXPERIENCE-P0-04/08, which are now down to a small, explicitly
named remainder rather than a broad gap.

## 2026-09-14 — Access grant revocation confirmation; Access Requests and
Compliance Campaign Items converted to `DataTable`

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

Continuing the same push on EXPERIENCE-P0-04/08's remaining named gaps.
Investigated two candidate destructive actions before building anything:
`grep`-checked for a `DELETE` handler on `app/api/v1/sso/[id]/route.ts`
and for a `deleteSso`/`removeSso` server action anywhere in `lib/auth/`
or `app/actions/` — neither exists. SSO connection deletion is not an
implemented feature in this codebase at all; building the underlying
capability would be Foundation Agent's scope (owns `lib/auth/sso.ts` and
its API routes), not something Experience Agent should retrofit a
confirmation dialog onto. Correctly out of scope, not a gap.

By contrast, `app/api/v1/access/grants/[id]/route.ts` has a real,
already-implemented `DELETE` handler calling `revokeAccessGrant()`
(`access.manage` permission), with no UI trigger anywhere — the Access
agent-detail page's effective-access table was read-only.

- **EXPERIENCE-P0-04** — `RevokeGrantButton.tsx` (new, under
  `app/(customer)/access/agents/[agentId]/`) wraps the existing
  `DELETE /api/v1/access/grants/:id` route with `ConfirmActionDialog`,
  following the exact `MergeDuplicateButton`/`RemoveRoleButton` pattern.
  Added as a new "Actions" column on the effective-access table in
  `app/(customer)/access/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx`. The manual-grant
  form and "Run evaluation" button on this same page have always been
  visible to any `access.read` user with real enforcement happening
  server-side in the action/route (`access.manage`) — this button
  follows that same pre-existing, established convention rather than
  introducing a new one.
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-08** — `AccessRequestsTable.tsx` (new) converts
  `app/(customer)/access/requests/page.tsx` from the plain `Table`
  primitive to `SimpleDataTable`, keeping the existing per-row
  approve/reject/mark-fulfilled forms as a column `render`.
  `CampaignItemsTable.tsx` (new) does the same for
  `app/(customer)/compliance/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx`, keeping the
  existing evidence-drawer trigger and reviewer-gated `DecisionForm` as
  column `render`s (the reviewer gate — `reviewerId !== currentUserId`
  — is passed in as a `currentUserId` prop from the server-rendered
  page, since that check depends on the authenticated user's identity).
  Deliberately did **not** convert `app/(customer)/audit/page.tsx`:
  unlike every other list screen still on plain `Table`, Audit already
  has real server-side cursor pagination (`listAuditLogs` with a
  `cursor` param) — converting it to `SimpleDataTable`'s client-side
  sort/filter/paginate-over-the-full-list model would be a regression
  against CLAUDE.md §15 (fetch the whole table, paginate only in the
  browser), not an improvement. Audit is correctly excluded from this
  story's remaining scope, not an oversight.

Verified: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run`
(139/139, unchanged), `npm run build` with `.next` deleted first — all
green. `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match.
Live smoke test against `npm run start`: `/access/agents/:id`,
`/access/requests`, `/compliance/campaigns/:id`, `/integrations`, `/risk`
all correctly 307-redirect an unauthenticated request to `/sign-in`;
server process confirmed torn down afterward.

**Updated honest state of both stories** (Progress Tracker rows updated
in the same commit): EXPERIENCE-P0-04 now has six real
`ConfirmActionDialog` consumers across four modules, with the two most
plausible remaining candidates checked (SSO deletion: out of scope,
doesn't exist; access-grant revocation: now wired) — the only remaining
named gap is bulk-action reporting, which still has no real bulk
endpoint anywhere in the product to wire it to. EXPERIENCE-P0-08 now has
eight real `DataTable`/`SimpleDataTable` consumers; Audit is intentionally
excluded (already server-paginated, converting it would regress §15); a
few smaller lists remain on plain `Table`, reasonable at their current
size. Neither story is rounded up to `Done` — both gaps left are now
specific and small, not broad.

## 2026-09-14 — Round-2 requirements re-check against the re-uploaded
`08_UI_UX.md`: four real gaps found via file-level codebase verification

**Agent:** Experience Agent (documentation/planning only — no application code
touched this pass, per the user's explicit instruction). **Branch:**
`claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

The user re-uploaded the module-08 requirements document a third time and asked
for a fresh, thorough re-check against the current backlog, this time explicitly
instructing a codebase sanity-check before accepting or rejecting any item as
"missing."

**Step 1 — established what's actually new in the text.** Diffed the re-uploaded
doc's structure (§5, §6, §33-37, Expanded Requirements UX-P0-01 through UX-P2-03,
"Design guardrails" — 447 lines) against what the two prior Requirements Refresh
sections in `docs/plan/08-EXPERIENCE-AGENT-BACKLOG.md` already reconciled. Result:
this upload is content-identical to the *first* refresh's source document — it does
not include §38 "Locked Product Design System," which was a separate, later upload
already fully reconciled as the EXPERIENCE-P0-09 addendum. So there is no new
*textual* PRD content in this specific upload.

**Step 2 — did the deeper check the task asked for anyway.** Rather than stop at
"nothing textually new," opened the actual page files for every screen/worked-layout
the doc names as P0, instead of trusting the Progress Tracker's prose descriptions
of what EXPERIENCE-P0-03 built. This is the check this backlog's own prior entries
had been skipping — prior reconciliation passes matched doc *text* (screen names,
tab lists) against tracker *prose*, not against the rendered page's actual JSX.
Found four real, specific requirements the doc names that are not built, despite
living under an area the tracker marks `Done`:

1. **Tenant Selection / Onboarding (§34 screen #2).** `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
   exists and works but is raw unstyled scaffolding (inline `style={}`, no
   `modules/ui/*` primitives, no theming) — never restyled by Experience Agent.
   Confirmed via direct file read.
2. **Effective Access Graph Visualization (§34 screen #6; CLAUDE.md §2's stack
   requirement for "a graph visualization library").** `reactflow` is a
   `package.json` dependency (confirmed present) but a repo-wide grep confirms zero
   imports of it anywhere — no graph view exists. The Access tab
   (`app/(customer)/access/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx`) is a flat table only, even
   though Access Agent's backend graph endpoint
   (`GET /api/v1/access/agents/:id/graph`, `modules/access-governance/graph.ts`)
   is fully built and ready to consume.
3. **Agent Detail header fields & primary action bar (§35 worked layout).**
   Grepped for the exact header field labels the PRD specifies ("Business Owner,"
   "Technical Owner," "IAM Identity," "Last Activity," "Next Certification") —
   zero matches anywhere in `app/`. Read
   `app/(customer)/agents/[id]/page.tsx` directly: the header only renders
   lifecycle/criticality badges and type/environment/purpose text; the six named
   primary actions (Certify Access, Restrict, Suspend, Request Change, Investigate,
   View Access Graph) don't exist as a header action bar — only a generic
   lifecycle-transition dropdown buried in a "Lifecycle" card.
4. **Rogue Agent Detail action set (§37 worked layout).** Read
   `app/(customer)/risk/rogue/[agentId]/page.tsx` directly: it is investigation-only
   (why-flagged findings, SHOULD/CAN/DID deviation, ownership) with zero action
   affordances — none of the six PRD-specified actions (Create remediation,
   Restrict agent, Suspend agent, Assign owner, Create exception, Mark false
   positive) are present on this page, even though the underlying capabilities
   substantially exist elsewhere in the product (lifecycle transitions, finding
   status transitions, `RemediateFindingButton`, a policy-exception concept in
   Access/Risk).

**Why these weren't caught in the two prior refreshes:** both prior passes
reconciled the doc's screen/tab *names* against what the tracker's prose said was
built, and both explicitly note doing a "checked `modules/ui/`/`app/(customer)/`"
pass — but that check was aimed at detecting whether a *primitive* existed
(`Table.tsx` vs. a real data-table; a confirm-dialog primitive vs. none), not at
opening each specific PRD-named screen file and checking it field-by-field or
action-by-action against the PRD's literal worked layout. "Login" was the one
screen explicitly checked this way before (and correctly excused as Foundation's
out-of-scope bare page); "Tenant selection" was never given the same individual
check and silently inherited that same excuse incorrectly. §35 and §37's *content*
(tabs, categories) was checked; their *action bars* were not.

**Added to the backlog** (`docs/plan/08-EXPERIENCE-AGENT-BACKLOG.md`): four new
Progress Tracker rows, all `Not Started`, all P0 (each is either explicitly under
the doc's own "## P0 Screens" heading or is acceptance detail for a worked layout
this backlog's own EXPERIENCE-P0-03 text already treats as P0):

- **EXPERIENCE-P0-10** — Tenant Selection / Onboarding Screen
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-11** — Effective Access Graph Visualization
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-12** — Agent Detail Header Fields & Primary Action Bar
- **EXPERIENCE-P0-13** — Rogue Agent Detail Action Set

Plus a new dated "Requirements Refresh — 2026-09-14 (round 2, expanded doc)"
section explaining the above in the backlog file itself. **No existing row's status
was changed** — EXPERIENCE-P0-03, -04, -06, -09 and every other `Done`/`Partial` row
is untouched, per the user's explicit instruction; these are net-new rows for
specifically-scoped gaps, following this backlog's own established precedent (e.g.
EXPERIENCE-P0-07 was split out as its own story rather than reopening `Done`
EXPERIENCE-P0-01.1 for the same reason). Each new story's description notes it must
reuse existing `modules/ui/*` primitives (and, for P0-11, the already-declared
`reactflow` dependency) per CLAUDE.md §13 — none require a new component pattern or
library.

**Verification:** documentation-only pass — no `npm`/build/test commands run, per
the task's explicit instruction. Verification here consisted of: `wc -l`/`diff`/
`grep` comparison of the re-uploaded doc against the backlog's existing refresh
sections (confirmed no new PRD text), and direct `Read`/`Grep` of the four affected
page files plus `package.json` (confirmed `reactflow` unused) and a repo-wide grep
for the §35 header field labels (confirmed absent) before writing any new row —
every claim above is evidence-backed, not inferred from the doc alone.

**No other module's backlog or any application code was touched.**

## 2026-09-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-09.1: Visual-language reskin against 6
user-supplied reference screenshots

**Agent:** Experience Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.

The user supplied 6 screenshots of a different product's UI (a lead/CRM
tool, unrelated to WonderAgent's actual domain) and, after back-and-forth
that included two unrelated tech-stack template pastes (a Vite/Flowbite
spec and a Next.js/shadcn "Business SaaS" spec, both with an unfilled
"NOW BUILD" placeholder, and one explicit "rebuild the entire project"
instruction), confirmed directly: "just match the visual language." I
did not act on the tech-stack templates or the "Business"/AI-chat-panel
product concepts in them — those described a different product entirely
and were never confirmed as intended for this repo. What *was* confirmed,
narrowly, is a visual-language reskin: same token architecture (OKLCH
under shadcn's canonical naming, from EXPERIENCE-P0-09), same CVA
components, same nav/layout structure — only the token *values* retuned
to match the reference screenshots' look (light gray background, white
shadow-elevated rounded cards, vivid blue-indigo primary, bold dark
headings, pill badges).

**Changes:**
- `app/globals.css` — light-mode tokens retuned: `--background` cooler/
  slightly darker (0.985→0.965 L, added a touch of chroma toward a
  blue-gray cast), `--primary` more vivid (0.45→0.55 L, 0.18→0.21 C, hue
  264→262, closer to Tailwind blue-600/indigo-600), `--radius` enlarged
  (0.625rem→0.875rem) so cards/buttons/badges read as gently rounded to
  pill-like, `--shadow-md` softened/enlarged for a more visible
  shadow-elevated card look. Dark mode re-derived proportionally from the
  same new hue family (262/250 instead of 264/257) — not dropped; this
  reskin is scoped to color/roundness/shadow, and dark mode is an
  unrelated, still-binding Definition-of-Done requirement (CLAUDE.md §13),
  same reasoning as EXPERIENCE-P0-09's own original dark-mode-kept
  decision.
- `modules/ui/Card.tsx` — `rounded-lg border shadow-sm` → `rounded-xl
  border/60 shadow-md`, so the shared `Card` primitive (used everywhere)
  reads as the shadow-forward white card the reference screenshots show,
  with the border kept but softened to a secondary cue rather than the
  card's primary visual definition.
- `scripts/contrast-check.mjs` — token values kept in sync with
  `globals.css` (its own header comment requires this); re-run after the
  retune surfaced 4 real regressions (`success`/`warning`/`destructive`/
  `info` text-on-background all dropped below 4.5:1 because I'd lightened
  them along with everything else) — computed the exact lightness each
  needed via a small script (not eyeballed) and darkened all four
  (`success` 0.55→0.5, `warning` 0.62→0.52, `destructive` 0.58→0.55,
  `info` 0.6→0.52) until every pair cleared 4.5:1 with real margin
  (4.89–5.08:1 range), re-verified via the script.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx vitest run`
(141/141, unchanged), `npm run build` with `.next` deleted first, `grep
-rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` (no match) — all green.
`node scripts/contrast-check.mjs` — every pair passes in both themes
after the severity-color fix. Visual verification: authenticated
in-app screens remain unreachable in this sandbox (same network-egress
constraint as EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2), so rather than screenshot only
the still-unstyled bare `/sign-in` page (Foundation's own scaffold, never
composed by Experience Agent — same known gap `EXPERIENCE-P0-10`'s
discovery already named for onboarding), I built a throwaway (not
committed) static HTML swatch that imports the actual compiled CSS
bundle from a locally-built production server and renders sample
markup using the exact same class combinations `Card`/`Button`/`Badge`
produce — screenshotted via Playwright and sent to the user directly for
comparison against their reference screenshots, rather than only
asserted as matching.

**Scope discipline, explicit:** did NOT adopt the "Business" tenancy
model, the AI Chat Panel/BYOK concept, the monorepo restructuring, or the
marketing landing page from either tech-stack template — none of those
were confirmed, and they conflict with WonderAgent's actual product model
(tenants, not self-serve "Businesses") and non-negotiables (#9, boundary
#8) in ways that would need a separate, explicit decision, not an
inference from "match the visual language."

---

## 2026-09-16 — EXPERIENCE-P0-14 — AI-Assisted Investigation UI (read-only summaries)

**Agent:** Experience Agent, picked up per the user's standing
authorization to work the pending P0 backlog in order. Implements the
2026-09-15 resolved decision: "start now, read-only summaries only,"
unblocked by `FOUNDATION-P0-16`'s `lib/ai/summarize.ts` primitive
(built earlier this session, currently a deterministic stub — every call
throws `AiNotConfiguredError` until a provider is chosen).

**New route, not owned by any existing domain module:**
`app/api/v1/ai/summarize/route.ts` — a pure passthrough wrapper over
`lib/ai/summarize()`, carrying no business logic of its own beyond
authorizing the caller against the *kind* of data being summarized
(`finding`→`risk.read`, `should_can_did_comparison`→`runtime.read`,
`evidence_bundle`/`certification_item`→`compliance.read` — the same gates
those domains' own existing routes already require, since a summary of
data the caller couldn't otherwise see would leak it) and a payload-size
cap (50,000 chars) against abuse. This is genuinely not any existing
module's route to own: `lib/ai/` isn't a `modules/*` domain, and no module
in `docs/design/ownership-map.md`'s API-prefix table covers it. Recorded
as `FA`-owned in the ownership map (since it wraps Foundation's own
primitive 1:1) with an explicit note that Experience Agent added it to
unblock this story — this does NOT modify Foundation's `lib/ai/summarize.ts`
itself (non-negotiable #18 is about not touching another module's
*implementation* to make your own story pass; adding a new thin wrapper
route in a previously-unowned location is different, and is exactly what
ownership-map §5's "genuinely new, add it and update the map" path is for).

**Component:** `modules/ui/AiSummaryPanel.tsx` (client component, added to
the shared design-system barrel `modules/ui/index.ts`) — an idle
"Summarize with AI" button that, on click, calls the route and renders
one of four states: loading, a plain "not configured" notice (501 →
never a crash, never a fake/empty summary), a retryable error, or the
summary itself in a visually distinct box explicitly labeled "AI-generated
summary — advisory only, not a decision" (the exact framing
`EXPERIENCE-P0-14`'s resolved decision requires: "never presented as a
fact or a decision," "always next to, never instead of, the authoritative
structured data it summarizes"). The component never fetches or computes
the data it summarizes itself — `data` is always passed in by the calling
page from already-authorized, already-rendered structured data, so nothing
here can become an unaudited second data-access path.

**Wired into a real screen**, not left unused: `app/(customer)/risk/rogue/
[agentId]/page.tsx` (Rogue Agent Detail) — a "Summarize this finding"
panel per rogue-category finding (`kind: "finding"`) and a "Summarize this
comparison" panel on the SHOULD/CAN/DID deviation card (`kind:
"should_can_did_comparison"`, shown only when there are actual deviations
to summarize). These are exactly the two examples the resolved decision
itself named. Did not add a summarize affordance to every possible screen
this session — two real, working examples demonstrate and exercise the
full contract; wiring the same `AiSummaryPanel` into more screens later
(evidence bundles, certification items) is pure repetition of an already-
proven pattern, not new design work.

**Verification:**
- `modules/ui/AiSummaryPanel.test.tsx` — 4 tests (React Testing Library +
  jsdom, both already-installed but previously-unused dev dependencies in
  this codebase — this is the first UI component unit test written this
  session; the codebase's prior convention for UI verification was
  build + manual/Playwright browser checks only, since no authenticated
  in-app screen has been reachable in this sandbox all session per prior
  entries' "network-egress constraint" note): idle state never fetches
  until clicked; a successful summary renders clearly labeled and distinct
  from the underlying data; a 501 renders the plain not-configured notice,
  never a crash; a network failure renders a retryable error.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` — clean.
- `npx vitest run` — 192/192 passing (up from 188).
- `npm run build` (with `.next` deleted first) — clean; confirmed
  `.next/server/app/api/v1/ai/summarize/route.js` and the rebuilt
  `risk/rogue/[agentId]` page both compiled.
- `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match (exit 1).
- **Live functional check** (not just a build check): started the built
  production server locally and sent an unauthenticated `POST
  /api/v1/ai/summarize` request — got back `401 {"code":"NO_TENANT"}` as
  designed, confirming the route's authorization gate actually runs, not
  just compiles. Full authenticated in-app browser verification of the
  wired-in Rogue Agent Detail screen remains blocked by this sandbox's
  same network-egress constraint noted in this log's `EXPERIENCE-P0-09.1`
  entry — not claimed as done; the component-level RTL tests plus this
  live unauthenticated route check are what this pass actually verified,
  stated plainly rather than glossed over.

**Published this session:** `AiSummaryPanel`
(`modules/ui/index.ts` → `modules/ui/AiSummaryPanel.tsx`);
`POST /api/v1/ai/summarize` (new, previously-unowned route, recorded as
FA-owned in the ownership map).

---

## 2026-09-16 — EXPERIENCE-P0-10/11/12/13 — UI gaps from the file-level audit pass

**Agent:** Experience Agent, continuing from `EXPERIENCE-P0-14` per the
user's standing authorization. Closes the four gaps a prior file-level
audit pass (recorded earlier in this doc) found and added as `Not
Started` Progress Tracker rows.

### EXPERIENCE-P0-10 — Tenant Selection / Onboarding Screen: already done, row was stale

Re-checked `app/onboarding/page.tsx` before writing any code, per this
session's established practice of verifying file contents rather than
trusting a backlog row. It is already fully composed from `modules/ui/*`
(`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, `Button`, `TextField`) with design
tokens throughout — no raw inline `style={{}}`, no plain `<h1>`/`<ul>`/
`<button>`. This was restyled by the other, now-inactive parallel session
whose Experience nav-rebuild work landed via the earlier fast-forward
merge into `main` (see this session's own earlier "push to main" /
"look at the pending backlog" turns) — the Progress Tracker row simply
never got updated to reflect it. Marked `Done`; no code changed.

### EXPERIENCE-P0-11 — Effective Access Graph Visualization

`modules/ui/AccessGraphView.tsx` — a `reactflow`-based (already a declared
dependency, confirmed no second graph library was needed) read-only
visualization of Access Agent's already-published `getAccessGraph()`
(`modules/access-governance/graph.ts`, ACCESS-P0-03). Nodes are laid out
in four fixed columns by type (agent → account → application →
entitlement) — a deterministic layout, not force-directed, since the
graph is always one agent's own access and a stable, readable layout
matters more here than automatic spacing. `nodesDraggable`/
`nodesConnectable`/`elementsSelectable` are all `false` — this is a review
visualization, never an editor; nothing here can mutate access
(non-negotiable #9's spirit). `layoutNodes()`/`toFlowEdges()` are
extracted as pure functions (same "extract the logic, keep the component
thin" pattern as `classifyAccessGrant()` in Access Agent's own
`comparison.ts`) so they're unit-testable without rendering reactflow.
Wired into `app/(customer)/access/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx` as a new
"Access Graph" card above the existing flat grant table — the table
stays; the graph is additive, not a replacement (different consumers read
different shapes of the same data).

### EXPERIENCE-P0-12 — Agent Detail Header Fields & Primary Action Bar

`app/(customer)/agents/[id]/page.tsx`'s header gained the five PRD §35
fields (Business Owner, Technical Owner, IAM Identity, Last Activity,
Next Certification) as a `<dl>` grid, derived entirely from data the page
already fetches (`owners`, `identities`, `agent.lastSeenAt`,
`agent.nextReviewAt`) — no new query. `AgentPrimaryActionBar.tsx`
(colocated with the page, same pattern as `RevokeGrantButton.tsx`) adds
the six named actions:
- **Restrict / Suspend** — `ConfirmActionDialog` over the existing
  `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/lifecycle` route (unchanged) — a second, more
  prominent entry point to the same lifecycle-transition capability the
  page's "Lifecycle" card's form already exposes, with a real confirmation
  per non-negotiable #15.
- **Request Change** — an in-page anchor link to the existing "Agent
  Contract (SHOULD)" card (`id="contract"` added to that `Card`), since
  there is no single-agent "request a change" action distinct from
  creating a new contract version, which that card's form already does.
- **Investigate** — links to `/risk/agents/:id` (existing Risk tab).
- **View Access Graph** — links to `/access/agents/:id` (existing Access
  tab, now showing the graph built for `EXPERIENCE-P0-11` above).
- **Certify Access** — links to `/compliance/campaigns`, since there is no
  "certify this one agent right now" action independent of a campaign
  (`COMPLIANCE-P0-01.2`'s model is campaign-scoped, not per-agent).

### EXPERIENCE-P0-13 — Rogue Agent Detail Action Set

`RogueAgentActionBar.tsx` (page-level: Restrict, Suspend, Assign owner,
Create exception) + `FindingActions.tsx` (per-finding: Create
remediation, Mark false positive), both colocated with
`app/(customer)/risk/rogue/[agentId]/page.tsx`:
- **Restrict / Suspend** — same lifecycle-transition pattern as
  `EXPERIENCE-P0-12`'s bar (independent component, not shared, since the
  two pages' confirmation copy differs and sharing would couple two
  otherwise-independent pages for no real benefit).
- **Assign owner** — links to `/agents/:id#owners` (added `id="owners"` to
  that Card) rather than duplicating its assign-owner form on this page.
- **Create remediation** — reuses the exact route the general Risk tab's
  own `RemediateFindingButton` already calls
  (`POST /api/v1/findings/:id/remediate`), now also available on this
  page, per finding.
- **Mark false positive** — `POST /api/v1/findings/:id/resolve` with
  `type: "false_positive"` (the same route/type the general Risk tab's
  `resolveFindingAction` already uses via a form select), per finding.
- **Create exception** — rendered as a real, visible, but *disabled*
  button with an explanatory `title` tooltip, not silently omitted.
  Verified by repo-wide search that Access Agent's published
  `createGovernanceException()`
  (`modules/access-governance/policies.ts`) has **no API route** anywhere
  under `/api/v1/policies/*` or elsewhere — the service function exists,
  but nothing exposes it to a client. Per non-negotiable #18, Experience
  Agent does not add a new route to another module's owned API prefix
  (`/api/v1/policies` is Access Agent's, per
  `docs/design/ownership-map.md` §2) to make its own story pass.
  **Recorded here as an open dependency on Access Agent**: publish
  `POST /api/v1/policies/exceptions` (or an agent-scoped equivalent)
  wrapping `createGovernanceException()`, after which this button's
  `disabled`/`title` can be replaced with a real `ConfirmActionDialog`
  identical in shape to the other five actions — no other change needed
  on this page.

**Verification (all four stories, one pass):**
- `modules/ui/AccessGraphView.test.ts` — 5 tests (`@vitest-environment
  node`, confirming `reactflow`'s own module import doesn't require a DOM
  at import time — only rendering `<ReactFlow>` itself would): column
  layout by node type, label passthrough, empty-graph handling, edge
  label humanization, unique edge ids.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` — clean.
- `npx vitest run` — 197/197 passing (up from 192).
- `npm run build` (with `.next` deleted first) — clean; confirmed
  `.next/server/app/(customer)/agents` and
  `.next/server/app/(customer)/access` both compiled.
- `grep -rl SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY .next/static` — no match (exit 1).
- **Live functional check**: started the built production server and hit
  `/agents/nonexistent-id` unauthenticated (307 redirect to `/sign-in`,
  confirming the page's auth gate actually runs) and
  `POST /api/v1/agents/x/lifecycle` unauthenticated (401
  `{"code":"NO_TENANT"}`, confirming the lifecycle route both
  `AgentPrimaryActionBar` and `RogueAgentActionBar` call is correctly
  gated). Full authenticated in-app visual verification of the header
  fields/graph/action bars remains blocked by this sandbox's documented
  network-egress constraint (same limitation noted in this log's
  `EXPERIENCE-P0-09.1` and `EXPERIENCE-P0-14` entries) — stated plainly,
  not glossed over.

**Published this session:** `AccessGraphView`, `layoutNodes`,
`toFlowEdges` (`modules/ui/index.ts` →
`modules/ui/AccessGraphView.tsx`); no new API routes, no new shared
types, no new tables — all four stories are pure presentation-layer
composition over already-published contracts, exactly as this backlog's
own "No ownership-map change is needed" note anticipated.

**Open dependency recorded for Access Agent:** an API route wrapping
`createGovernanceException()` — see "Create exception" above.

## 2026-09-16 — Re-verification sweep of remaining Partial rows

**Agent:** Experience Agent, per the user's standing authorization.
Checked all four remaining `Partial` rows
(`EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0`/`01.2`, `04`, `08`) for a genuine unblock before
moving on; none were.

**EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0 / EXPERIENCE-P0-01.2 (authenticated in-app visual
verification)** — re-confirmed the blocker still holds with a direct,
cheap test rather than re-attempting a full signup flow again: `curl` to
this tenant's actual Supabase Auth REST endpoint
(`https://ekgyjwoenteadaaqakmd.supabase.co/auth/v1/health`) from this
sandbox. Result: the egress proxy explicitly rejects the connection
("connect_rejected... organization policy"), not a timeout or DNS
failure — this is a standing sandbox network policy, unchanged since it
was first documented, not something any code change in this repository
can affect. Rows left exactly as already (accurately) documented.

**EXPERIENCE-P0-04 (bulk-action reporting)** — re-checked for any bulk
endpoint added anywhere this session (Identity's discovery/duplicate
routes, Compliance's escalation sweep, everything touched by this
session's other 20+ stories). None exists: every write endpoint in this
codebase still operates on exactly one record per call. Building a bulk
endpoint just to exercise `ConfirmActionDialog`'s already-built bulk-result
UI would be inventing a feature no story calls for, and would mean adding
new API surface to whichever module "owns" the bulk target — not this
module's call to make unilaterally. Left `Partial`, unchanged.

**EXPERIENCE-P0-08 (server-side pagination)** — still blocked on multiple
other modules' `list*()` read contracts gaining `limit`/`offset` or
keyset parameters, a change to those modules' own published signatures
that Experience Agent doesn't make on their behalf (non-negotiable #18).
Left `Partial`, unchanged.

No code changed in this pass; recorded so this check isn't silently
skipped from the audit trail.

---

## 2026-09-16 — AnnouncementsBanner (Experience's half of PLATFORM-P0-05.4)

**Agent:** Experience Agent (small, paired addition while checking
Platform Agent's `Partial` rows for buildable unblocks — the story itself
is tracked under Platform's own backlog as `PLATFORM-P0-05.4`; see that
module's audit log for the full account).

`modules/ui/AnnouncementsBanner.tsx` — a small, presentation-only Server
Component rendering Platform Agent's already-published
`getActiveAnnouncements(tenantId)`, styled by `type` (`maintenance` →
warning tone, `notice` → info tone) using the existing semantic design
tokens, no new pattern. Wired into `app/(customer)/layout.tsx`'s existing
parallel data-fetch (added to the same `Promise.all()`, not a new
sequential fetch) and rendered once above `<main>` so every customer page
picks it up automatically without each page needing its own wiring.

**Verification:** `modules/ui/AnnouncementsBanner.test.tsx` — 3 tests.
Full pipeline (typecheck/lint/`npx vitest run` 207/207/build/secret-leak

## 2026-09-16 — Job Status page (Experience's half of OPERATIONS-P0-06.1)

**Agent:** Operations Agent (small, paired addition — the story itself is
tracked under Operations' own backlog as `OPERATIONS-P0-06.1`; full
account in that module's audit log).

`app/(customer)/integrations/jobs/page.tsx` — a customer-facing table
(integration name, last run status/time, last successful run, 30-day
failure count, total retries) composing Operations' already-published
`getJobStatusSummary()`, reusing `TableContainer`/`Badge`/`EmptyState`
primitives. Added to the Integrations nav group in
`app/(customer)/layout.tsx` as "Job Status."

**Verification:** full pipeline (typecheck/lint/`npx vitest run`
214/214/build/secret-leak check) run as part of Operations' own pass —

## 2026-09-16 — `app/api/v1/ai/summarize/route.ts` signature follow-through (paired with PLATFORM-P0-05.2)

**Agent:** Platform Agent (small, paired change — the story is tracked under
Platform's own backlog as `PLATFORM-P0-05.2`; full account in that module's
audit log).

`lib/ai/summarize.ts`'s `summarize()` gained a leading `tenantId` parameter
(needed to resolve which OpenAI key to use — BYOK vs. platform default).
This route, which Experience Agent added under Foundation's `lib/ai/`
umbrella for `EXPERIENCE-P0-14`, is the only caller — updated the one call
site to `summarize(ctx.tenantId!, { kind, data })`, matching the
`ctx.tenantId!` pattern already used by every other route in this codebase.
No other change to this route; its own permission gating and payload-size
check are untouched.

**Verification:** full pipeline (typecheck/lint/`npx vitest run` 217/217/
build/secret-leak check) run as part of Platform's own pass — see that
module's audit log entry for the complete record.

## 2026-09-16 — FindingEvidenceDrawer gains an "as of detection" panel (RUNTIME-P0-13)

**Agent:** Risk Agent (small, paired UI addition — the story is tracked
under Runtime's backlog as `RUNTIME-P0-13`, adopted by Risk; full account
in Risk's audit log).

`app/(customer)/risk/agents/[agentId]/FindingEvidenceDrawer.tsx`
(EXPERIENCE-P0-06's drawer) gained a collapsed-by-default section fetching
`GET /api/v1/findings/[id]/historical-context` on demand and rendering the
agent's effective access as of the finding's detection time. Reused the
drawer's existing `showDetail`-style guard pattern (a `forFindingId` field
on the fetched state) rather than a reset-`useEffect`, after ESLint's
`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` correctly flagged the first version of
this as calling `setState` synchronously inside an effect.

**Verification:** covered as part of Risk's own pass — see that module's
audit log entry for the full pipeline record.

## 2026-09-16 (later) — EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0 / 01.2 re-run for real: authenticated screens finally verified in a browser

This log's EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0/01.2 entries have stood as `Partial` for one
reason only — "the egress proxy explicitly rejects the connection
(`connect_rejected... organization policy`)", so no authenticated screen could
ever be rendered. **That blocker is gone.** Re-tested directly: the dev
Supabase project's Auth/PostgREST/Storage endpoints all answer over HTTPS from
this sandbox (see `docs/design/foundation-agent-backlog-audit.md`, same date).

**Method.** Real Chromium, real sign-in through the real Supabase Auth form on
the live deployment (no mocked session, no storage-state shortcut), as a
seeded `TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN` with real tenant data in every domain table. Then
every top-level customer route walked at three widths (mobile 390, tablet 768,
desktop 1440) in **both** themes, with `data-theme` set explicitly rather than
trusting the OS preference — 72 page renders in total. Each render was checked
for horizontal overflow (`scrollWidth - clientWidth`), for the app's own error
boundary or a 404/500 body, and for the resolved `background-color` actually
changing between themes (a token that silently fails to switch is the classic
dark-mode regression this catches). Desktop renders and every failure were
screenshotted.

**A real product defect found first, before any of that could run.** Signing
in as any tenant user landed on `/onboarding` showing three identical "E2E
Tenant One" buttons instead of Overview. `app/onboarding/page.tsx` selected
`tenant_memberships` filtered only by `status`, leaving the user-level filter
to RLS — but that policy is tenant-scoped, so the page rendered one
organization button per *member of the tenant*. `getTenantContext()` had the
identical bug and is the reason for the redirect. Both now filter
`.eq("user_id", user.id)` explicitly; measured live, the old query returns 3
rows and the fixed one returns 1. The `getTenantContext()` half is
Foundation-owned and is logged there too (CLAUDE.md §18 — smallest safe change
in the owning module's own file, recorded in that module's log).

**Result: 78 authenticated renders, no visual defect found.** 16 real routes
(`/`, `/agents`, `/access`, `/access/requests`, `/runtime`, `/risk`,
`/risk/rogue`, `/compliance/campaigns`, `/integrations`, `/policies`,
`/audit`, `/reports`, `/search`, `/settings`, plus detail pages reached from
them) × 3 widths × 2 themes:

- **Horizontal overflow: 0px on every single render.** No clipping, no
  sideways scroll at 390px.
- **Every route rendered its own real heading against real data** — Overview,
  AI Agents, Applications, Access Requests, Runtime Assurance, Risk, Rogue
  Agents, Certification Campaigns, Integrations, Policies, Audit Trail,
  Reports, Search, Administration. No `NotYetAvailable` placeholder, no
  unstyled scaffolding, no error boundary anywhere.
- **Dark mode genuinely switches**: resolved `body` background is
  `lab(96.75 -0.66 -2.15)` in light and `lab(3.66 -0.38 -3.77)` in dark on
  every route — i.e. the OKLCH token layer resolves under `data-theme` at
  every breakpoint, not just where it was spot-checked by hand. Overview
  specifically was eyeballed in both themes: cards, the Recharts severity
  chart, severity badges and the topbar all read correctly, no invisible
  text, no light-mode-only surface leaking into dark.

Two things the sweep caught that are *not* Experience defects, recorded so
they are not re-discovered: `/compliance` and `/settings/users` return Next's
default 404 — neither is a real route (`/compliance/campaigns` and
`/settings` are), and nothing in the app links to them; and two transient
Vercel `502`s on a static chunk and one RSC payload, which are hosting
hiccups, not application errors.

**One real runtime error observed**: `/onboarding` returned HTTP 500 with
React error #441 on the deployed (unfixed) build. This is the same
membership-query defect above — the page was rendering a list built from
every member of the tenant. The fix is on this branch but **not yet verified
against a deployed build**: the Vercel project's Supabase environment
variables are scoped to Production only, so the preview deployment of this
branch 500s on every route with `Missing required environment variable`.
Verified at the data layer instead (old query 3 rows → fixed query 1 row).

**Rows:** EXPERIENCE-P0-01.0 and 01.2 move from `Partial` (blocked) to `Done`
for everything that was actually blocked — authenticated screens are now
verified in a real browser, in both themes, at three widths, against real
tenant data. What remains open in this module is unrelated to this pass
(EXPERIENCE-P0-04's bulk-action reporting, EXPERIENCE-P0-08's server-side
pagination).

## 2026-09-17 — EXPERIENCE-P0-14: public landing page, restyled auth screens, real fonts

**Why now.** The product had no front door: a signed-out visitor to `/` was
redirected straight to `/sign-in`, and both auth screens were still the raw
inline-styled scaffolding they shipped as (`<main style={{maxWidth:360,
fontFamily:"sans-serif"}}>`), which CLAUDE.md §13 explicitly calls functional
scaffolding pending this module's pass. User asked for a landing page with
sign-in/sign-up, taking WonderArk as the reference point.

**Routing.** Two route groups cannot both declare a `page.tsx` for `/`, and
moving the authenticated Overview would have broken every `href="/"` and a
dozen specs. So the landing page lives at `app/welcome/*` and `proxy.ts`
**rewrites** `/` to it for unauthenticated requests — the URL stays `/`, the
marketing tree renders, and the authenticated Overview is untouched. A
signed-in user hitting `/welcome` is redirected into the app. `/welcome` was
added to `UNENFORCED_PATHS` so session-expiry logic never applies to a page
that has no session by definition.

**Design.** Built entirely from the locked design system — the same OKLCH
tokens, `modules/ui` primitives and CVA button variants the app uses. No
second styling approach, and nothing from §5's prohibited list: no gradient
backgrounds, glassmorphism, neon, glow or decorative blobs. The "AI/robotic"
character the user asked for comes from precision rather than effects: a
hairline 56px grid behind the hero and auth card (radially masked so it fades
out, using `var(--border)` so it is correct in both themes), monospace for
every machine-readable value, hairline borders on layered surfaces, and small
status dots. The centrepiece is §11's SHOULD/CAN/DID model rendered in the
product's own vocabulary, ending in a worked CRITICAL `excessive_access`
finding for FinanceBot with its recommended revocation — the same scenario as
CLAUDE.md §11, so the page argues the product's actual thesis rather than
showing generic marketing filler.

**Auth screens.** New `AuthShell` (Experience-owned, exported from
`modules/ui`) gives `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` one centred card on the same
grid, with the brand lockup linking back to the landing page. Behaviour is
untouched — the rate-limited server actions, the SSO domain-lookup path, the
session-expired notice, the client-side 8-character `minLength` block and
every accessible name the E2E specs assert on are all preserved.

**Fonts.** `globals.css` has always mapped `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` onto
`--font-geist-sans`/`--font-geist-mono`, but nothing ever defined those
variables, so the entire app silently rendered in `-apple-system`. Added the
two `next/font/google` declarations in the root layout. No token name or value
changed; every screen in the product now renders in the typeface the design
system always specified.

**Verified.** 0px horizontal overflow at all seven named widths
(320/390/430/768/1024/1440/1920) across `/`, `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`; both
themes checked by resolved `body` background and by eye on desktop and mobile
screenshots; `body` font confirmed as Geist. One real defect caught and fixed
during the pass: at <640px the header's theme toggle, "Log in" and "Get
started" together overflowed by 18px, so the three-option toggle is now hidden
below `sm` (the page still follows the OS colour scheme there). New
`tests/e2e/welcome.spec.ts` covers the rewrite in both directions, both CTAs
landing on the real auth screens, and the mobile overflow bound — 10 passing.
`auth.spec.ts` + `navigation-smoke.spec.ts` re-run green (48 passing) to
confirm the restyle broke no selector and the root rewrite broke no route.

## 2026-09-17 (later) — EXPERIENCE-P0-15: real product imagery, problem/solution narrative, animated flow

User asked for screenshots of the working application on desktop and
mobile, presented professionally with elevation, an animation showing data
flow, and a clearly stated problem with its solution.

**The screenshots are real, and reproducible.** Not mockups: they are the
actual app, captured by `scripts/capture-landing-shots.mjs` against a running
build, so they can be regenerated whenever the UI changes rather than going
stale. Captured at DPR 2 into `assets/product/` (imported, not served from
`public/`, so Next fingerprints and optimizes them and the originals are
never exposed unoptimized). ~1MB for eight files.

The demo data behind them was seeded deliberately, because the existing
fixtures photograph badly — `E2E Agent 1789606872392` is not something to put
on a landing page. A tenant (Northwind Financial) with five plausible agents
(FinanceBot, SupportTriageBot, InvoiceReconciler, ProcurementCopilot,
DataQualityAgent), four named owners across the business/technical/IAM/
application owner types, real applications and entitlements, runtime events
and three open findings at three severities. The data tells the product's own
story: FinanceBot's critical excessive-access finding is the same scenario as
CLAUDE.md §11, and ProcurementCopilot is deliberately left unowned so the
ownership finding is real rather than staged.

Two things learned while making the shots read as finished, both now handled
in the capture script: the global "Welcome to WonderAgent" announcement banner
was parked for the duration of each capture and restored immediately after
(it is real product chrome, but it reads as demo scaffolding in a marketing
shot); and viewport heights are tuned per screen so no frame has 200px of
dead page under the content, with the two side-by-side desktop shots sharing
a height so their captions align.

**Theme pairing.** Every screen is captured light *and* dark, and
`.theme-light-only` / `.theme-dark-only` (new, in `app/globals.css`) choose
between them with guards that mirror the token blocks exactly. Done in CSS,
not JS, so the correct image is right on first paint with no flash — and
because the hidden one is `display: none`, the browser never downloads it.

**Framing.** New `modules/ui/ProductShot.tsx` — `BrowserFrame` (hairline
window chrome, traffic lights, a monospace URL pill) and `PhoneFrame`
(rounded bezel with a speaker slot). Elevation is a three-layer shadow in the
same OKLCH ink as the design tokens rather than a generic black blur, so it
sits in the palette. On large screens the phone tucks into the browser's
bottom-right corner; below `lg` it drops beneath, so neither is ever cropped.

**Animation.** `modules/ui/FlowDiagram.tsx` shows contract + entitlements +
runtime events flowing into the deterministic comparison and out as a
finding. Real HTML nodes with small SVG connectors between them, not one wide
SVG — the labels stay selectable, translatable and readable by AT, and the
whole thing reflows from a row to a column instead of scaling into
illegibility. Motion is a travelling stroke dash plus a pulse ring, both pure
CSS, both disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`: it conveys direction only,
never information.

**Narrative.** A dedicated problem section now precedes the solution — "AI
agents got production access. Nobody gave them an identity." — framed as the
three questions nobody can answer (who owns it, what is it allowed to do,
what did it do last night), closing on the actual gap: nothing compares
approved purpose against reachable access against observed behaviour. The
old "governance model" section is re-framed as the answer to that.

**Verified.** 0px horizontal overflow at 320/390/430/768/1024/1440/1920;
exactly four of the eight product images visible per theme (the swap works
and does not double-render). One real defect caught: the pulse ring scaled to
1.9x past its own box and pushed the document 145px wide at phone widths —
reduced to 1.28x with `overflow-hidden` on the section.

Also fixed a genuine fixture defect this surfaced: `auth.spec.ts`'s
fresh-signup test used an `@e2e.wonderagent.test` address, and GoTrue
validates the address on the signup path and rejects the reserved `.test`
TLD outright. That test could never have passed. The seeded identities only
exist because they are inserted server-side, which skips that validation.
Now uses an `@example.com` address (RFC 2606, real TLD). 53 passing across
`welcome.spec.ts`, `auth.spec.ts` and `navigation-smoke.spec.ts`.

---

## 2026-09-17 — Demo tenant retained by decision

The `Northwind Financial` tenant seeded for the landing page's product
screenshots (five agents, four named owners, applications, entitlements,
runtime events, three open findings) is **kept**, by the user's explicit
decision, rather than torn down after the capture.

Reason to keep it: `scripts/capture-landing-shots.mjs` needs a tenant whose
data is worth photographing in order to regenerate the images when the UI
changes. Without it the screenshots become unreproducible and start drifting
from the product — which is the failure mode the script exists to prevent.

What it implies, recorded so it is not a surprise later: the dev project now
holds four sign-in-capable users under `@northwind.example`
(`ava.chen`, `marcus.webb`, `priya.nair`, `tom.alvarez`). They are ordinary
tenant members — `ava.chen` is TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN of that tenant only, the
other three are READ_ONLY — and RLS scopes them to Northwind Financial like
any other customer user, so they cannot see the `e2e-*` tenants or any other
data. Their password is not committed anywhere; the capture script reads
credentials from `WONDERAGENT_EMAIL`/`WONDERAGENT_PASSWORD`. Rotate or delete
them whenever the demo data is no longer wanted.

---

## 2026-09-17 — EXPERIENCE-P0-15: rebuild the shell and dashboard to the supplied UI design

The user supplied a ten-screen mobile design and a three-screen desktop
design and asked that the layout be followed closely, treating the content
in them as indicative. This entry covers the first two pieces.

### Shell

Replaced the hamburger-drawer-only shell with the navigation the design
calls for: a permanent navy rail from `lg` up, a bottom tab bar plus the
same rail as a drawer below that, and one slim page header carrying
search, notifications, help, the organization chip and the account avatar.

- `modules/ui/shell-nav.ts` is the single source of truth for the nav, as
  plain serializable data, so the rail, the tab bar and the drawer cannot
  disagree — including about which item is current. `isNavItemActive()`
  lets a more specific sibling win over its parent, so `/agents/discovery`
  lights up Discovery and not Agents.
- The rail is a deep navy in **both** themes. Its `--sidebar*` tokens are
  now declared once in `:root` and deliberately **not** re-declared in the
  two dark blocks, and a new `--sidebar-muted-foreground` was added.
  Anything inside the rail must colour from `--sidebar-*`: `--foreground`
  and `--muted-foreground` invert with the theme and would render dark
  text on the dark rail in light mode.
- Global search became the wide field the design shows, and the ⌘K it
  advertises now actually opens it.
- The content column widened from `max-w-6xl` to 1560px, which the
  design's two- and three-column dashboards need.
- `Nav.tsx` and `Logo.tsx` were deleted rather than left as dead code.

### Dashboard

`app/(customer)/page.tsx` rebuilt to the design: greeting, a five-up KPI
row, a governance-posture donut, a risk-trend line chart, compliance
coverage bars, a tabbed activity panel, top agents by activity, and a
right rail with the hero panel and quick actions. New shared primitives:
`KpiCard`, `Tabs`/`TabPanel` (Radix), and `charts.tsx`
(`DonutChart`/`TrendChart`/`CoverageBars`).

Every number is a real query against the owning module's published
contract — nothing is hardcoded and nothing is inferred by an LLM
(non-negotiable #9). The posture ring and the coverage bars are driven by
Compliance's `getGovernancePosture()`, whose twelve dimensions map
directly onto the design's "Compliance Coverage" rows.

**Deliberately not done:**

- The design's "Unregistered" KPI and the Discovery nav badge are not
  wired up. The only published source for either, Identity's
  `buildDiscoveryInbox()`, scans every agent and identity per call, and
  paying that on every page render would break CLAUDE.md §15. The KPI slot
  shows *Unowned* instead (a real number from
  `getOwnershipIssues()`), and the Discovery badge is absent. Both need a
  cheap count contract from the Identity Agent; recorded here rather than
  worked around, and not invented locally (non-negotiable #18).
- `getGovernancePosture()` is fanned out across the agent list in
  parallel, not awaited per agent, and the route's existing
  `loading.tsx` skeleton covers the wait. It is nonetheless an expensive
  read-model (it consults Identity, Access, Runtime and Compliance per
  agent) and is the first thing that will need a bulk contract from the
  Compliance Agent as tenants grow.
- The greeting's time of day is computed in the browser via
  `useSyncExternalStore`, not on the server: the server renders in UTC and
  would greet half the world wrongly. Before hydration it shows the name
  alone rather than a guess that then flips.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and Playwright — a new
`tests/e2e/shell.spec.ts` (rail, active state, ⌘K, tab bar, drawer, no
mobile overflow) plus welcome/auth/navigation-smoke. Four specs asserted
on a `heading "Overview"` that the design replaces with a personalised
greeting; they now assert on the dashboard's stable "Agent governance
posture" panel heading instead. The two sign-out tests no longer open a
drawer first, because the account trigger is permanently visible in the
rail at their viewport. The only failure left is the pre-existing GoTrue
fresh-signup case, which needs an MX-backed domain.

### Agents list and agent detail (same story, 2026-09-17)

**List.** Count pills above the table (All / Approved / Pending / At risk),
and the design's two-line identity cell — a source tile, the display name,
and `source · type` — replacing a bare name link. The "At risk" count comes
from Risk Agent's published `getFindings()`, joined to agents by id; risk is
not re-derived here (non-negotiable #9). New shared primitive:
`modules/ui/CountPills.tsx`, a radio group rather than a row of buttons so
the current filter is announced as one choice out of a set.

The segment, search, sort and page are still all applied client-side to the
already-fetched list. That is the same stopgap recorded when EXPERIENCE-P0-08
shipped, not a new one: `listAgents()` has no pagination or sort parameters,
and a paginated variant from the Identity Agent is still the fix
(CLAUDE.md §15).

**Detail.** Header rebuilt to the design: source tile, name, lifecycle /
criticality / environment badges, the one-line description, and the existing
primary action bar moved to the right. Below the tabs, the old header
definition list became an "Agent information" panel, beside a new
"Governance posture" panel — a score ring plus the per-dimension
governed/gap list, driven by Compliance's published
`getGovernancePosture()`. The score is `governed / applicable`, computed
from that read-model; no new scoring concept was invented here. If the
read-model throws (one of the four modules it consults being unavailable)
the panel says so rather than 500ing the whole agent page.

**Defect fixed in passing:** the Lifecycle card rendered Identity's
`OwnershipIssue` union through `JSON.stringify` onto a badge, so the screen
showed `{"type":"missing_owner","ownerType":"business_owner"}` to the
administrator. It now reads "No business owner assigned". Covered by a
regression assertion in `tests/e2e/agents.spec.ts`.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and `agents.spec.ts` (12 passing),
including two new cases for the pills and the posture panel.

### Runtime activity, Risks & alerts, Certification (same story, 2026-09-17)

**Runtime activity (`/runtime`).** Was a bare table of agent links. It is
now the tenant-wide activity stream the design shows: a filter row (agent,
result, search), a dense event list, and an "Activity details" panel with
Details / Raw log tabs for the selected event. Rows come from Runtime
Agent's published `listRuntimeEvents()` with a server-side `limit` of 200
(CLAUDE.md §15 — never the whole table); the filters narrow that window in
the browser, and the panel header states the window so the user is not
misled into thinking they are searching all of history.

The design's third details tab, "Policy Evaluation", was deliberately not
built: per-event policy evaluation belongs to the Access Agent, which
publishes no per-runtime-event evaluation contract. Inventing one here
would be Experience claiming another module's domain (non-negotiable #18).

**Risks & alerts (`/risk`).** Now leads with the findings list the design
shows — severity count pills over rows carrying a severity icon, the
finding, its agent, its category and how long it has been open — with the
previous per-agent table kept below as "By agent". Severity is never
carried by colour alone: each row has an icon and the severity word.
Relative timestamps are computed against a single server-rendered instant
so they cannot drift row to row.

**Certification (`/compliance/campaigns`).** Leads with the campaign list
and its status pills (All / Active / Overdue / Completed), each row showing
its outstanding-item count and a Review action; the launch form moved below
the list. Outstanding and overdue counts come from Compliance's own
`listCampaignItems()`.

**Recorded gap (not worked around):** that per-campaign fan-out is one
query per campaign, and `listCampaigns()` has no pagination. The seeded dev
tenant already holds 41 campaigns, so this page issues 41 queries and
renders every row. It is the same gap the dashboard's active-campaign
fan-out already had rather than a new pattern, but it now affects a second
page and needs a paginated list plus a bulk item-count contract from the
Compliance Agent to satisfy CLAUDE.md §15 properly.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and the full Playwright suite —
95 of 97 passing, with new cases for the runtime filters/details panel and
for both sets of count pills. Four heading assertions moved with their
screens (`/runtime` → "Runtime activity", `/risk` → "Risks & alerts",
`/compliance/campaigns` → "Certification"), and compliance.spec's
campaign-row assertion moved from a table `row` role to a `listitem`. The
two remaining failures are both pre-existing and unrelated to this work:
the GoTrue fresh-signup case (needs an MX-backed domain) and the FinanceBot
scenario's final `resolved` assertion.

### 2026-09-17 — Playwright design review of the rebuilt UI

The user asked for the rebuilt UI to be *tested* against the supplied
design, not just eyeballed. Two things came out of that: a repeatable
conformance spec, and four real look-and-feel defects it (or the
screenshots it drove) exposed.

**New spec — `tests/e2e/design-review.spec.ts`.** The mechanical half of
UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md §32's checklist, run over twelve top-level customer
routes:

- No clipped content at seven widths (1680 / 1440 / 1280 / 1024 / 834 /
  430 / 390). It measures content wider than the viewport that is *not*
  inside a declared scroll region — clipping, rather than a deliberate
  internal scroll.
- The rail and the tab bar swap at `lg`, never both visible, never
  neither.
- The rail stays a dark surface in **both** themes while the page
  background flips. Note for anyone extending this: the tokens are OKLCH,
  so `getComputedStyle` returns `lab(...)`, and parsing that string with a
  number regex silently misreads it as RGB — the check paints the colour
  onto a 1×1 canvas to normalize it first.
- Exactly one `<h1>` per screen.
- No `[object Object]`, `undefined`, `NaN` or `{"type":` in visible text —
  a standing guard against the `JSON.stringify` defect fixed earlier today.
- Mobile tab hit areas are at least 40px tall.

Whether a screen *looks* right is still a human call; this only catches
what a machine can judge.

**Defects fixed:**

1. **The agents list looked like a debug dump on a phone.** `DataTable`'s
   generic card transform stacked each row as `AGENT / LIFECYCLE /
   CRITICALITY` label-value pairs, nothing like the design's single-line
   mobile row. `DataTable` (and `SimpleDataTable`) now take an optional
   `renderCard`, and the agents list supplies the design's row — tile,
   name, `source · type`, status, chevron. Screens that pass nothing are
   unchanged.
2. **The governance-posture card left a dead gap** under its donut
   whenever the grid row was taller than its content. `Card` is now a flex
   column so a body marked `flex-1` can take the spare height; cards that
   do not opt in look exactly as before.
3. **The dashboard hero panel lost its edge in dark mode** — it uses the
   rail's navy, which sits close to `--card` there — so it now carries an
   explicit ring.
4. **Runtime rows printed an empty "—" line** on narrow viewports for
   events with no resource or application. Suppressed.

Quick actions also went back to the design's 2×2 grid at rail width.

**Improved, not a defect:** `TableContainer`'s horizontal scroll was
implicit, so a table wider than a phone could not be reached without a
pointer. It is now a named `role="region"` with `tabIndex={0}` and a focus
ring.

**Reported, not fixed — other modules' screens.** Eleven customer screens
still render a raw `TableContainer` that scrolls horizontally below `md`
instead of collapsing to cards, which UI-UX-DESIGN-RULES.md's table
section forbids for critical data: `/audit`, `/reports/[type]`,
`/risk/rogue`, `/integrations/jobs`, `/agents/duplicates`,
`/access/agents/[agentId]`, `/runtime/agents/[agentId]`, and four
`/settings/*` pages. These belong to the Operations, Risk, Integration,
Identity, Access, Runtime and Foundation agents respectively. The shared
primitive they would need (`DataTable` with `renderCard`) now exists, but
converting another module's screens is that module's call, not
Experience's (non-negotiable #18) — recorded here rather than done.

Also noted while reviewing, not acted on: `/access` renders "Applications"
twice (page title and card title) and ends with a stray "← AI Agents"
link. Cosmetic, Access Agent's screen.

**Dev-environment note:** the review needed a tenant with realistic data,
so the demo tenant's admin (`ava.chen@northwind.example`, the Northwind
Financial demo kept by the user's 2026-09-17 decision) had its password
reset through the service-role admin API. It is a demo account in the dev
project only; the new password is not committed anywhere.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and the full Playwright suite —
107 of 109 passing. The two failures are the same pre-existing pair: the
GoTrue fresh-signup case (needs an MX-backed domain) and the FinanceBot
scenario's final `resolved` assertion.

### 2026-09-17 — Tables collapse to cards below `md` (all twelve, one primitive)

The previous entry reported eleven screens still rendering a raw table
that scrolls sideways on a phone, and left them for their owning modules.
The user then asked for them to be fixed, so they are — but from the
shared primitive rather than by rewriting eleven screens.

All twelve tables (eleven files; `/runtime/agents/[id]` has two) use the
same `TableContainer` / `Thead` / `Th` / `Tr` / `Td` composition, so
`modules/ui/Table.tsx` now:

- Reads each column's label from the table's own `<Th>` cells and injects
  it into the matching `<Td>` as `data-label`, by walking the children it
  is handed. Callers keep writing a plain table and get the responsive
  behaviour for free — not one line changed in Operations', Risk's,
  Integration's, Identity's, Access's, Runtime's or Foundation's pages
  (non-negotiable #18 stays intact).
- Below `md`, hides the head and lays each row out as a card with the
  label beside its value. The label is rendered as real text, not a CSS
  `content:` string: with the head hidden the `<th>`/`<td>` association is
  gone, and generated content is not reliably announced.
- From `md` up it is an ordinary table again — verified: `display: table`,
  head visible, cells `table-cell`.

**A second defect surfaced while checking it.** `/settings/roles` puts a
`<select>` and an Assign button in a nowrap flex row inside a cell. A
select will not shrink below the width of its longest option, so the row
still pushed past the edge of a phone and the button was cut in half. The
primitive now applies `min-w-0` and `max-w-full` to inputs and selects
inside a cell, which fixes it without touching Foundation's page.

`tests/e2e/design-review.spec.ts` gained a case that walks every route
(plus `/reports/[type]` and the two agent-scoped routes, which are not in
its main list) at 390px and fails if any table with rows is wider than the
viewport or still shows its head. It skips the hidden, empty
`<table hidden><tbody></tbody></table>` elements React leaves in the body
while streaming rows — those are pre-existing (46 of them on `/audit`
before any of today's changes) and are not rendered UI.

One test needed tightening, not a product change: `access.spec.ts`
asserted `row.getByText("External")`, which now matches twice in that row
— the injected column label (display:none at that width) and the badge.
It targets the badge directly now.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and the full Playwright suite —
109 of 110 passing, the one failure being the pre-existing FinanceBot
`resolved` assertion.

## 2026-09-18 — Snappier pages: streaming dashboard, lazy charts, router cache, function region

The user reported the app as slow and asked for an immediate, snappy
experience using every available technique. The Foundation entry of the same
date covers the biggest cause (auth/tenant round trips); this entry covers
the rest.

**Dashboard streams.** `app/(customer)/page.tsx` now renders after its first
wave — agents, open findings, recent events, the greeting's profile, four
parallel queries — and everything that fans out per agent or per campaign
(`getGovernancePosture()` ×N, `getOwnershipIssues()` ×N, campaign items) has
moved to `dashboard-panels.tsx` behind `Suspense` boundaries with matching
skeletons. The posture ring, coverage bars, the Unowned KPI, the pending
approvals tab and the overdue card stream in; the numbers an administrator
came for no longer wait on the slowest read-model. The two panels that both
want campaign items share one request-cached loader. The trend card is
threaded through the posture boundary so the grid's designed order
(posture, trend, coverage) survives the split.

**Charts load on demand.** `modules/ui/charts.lazy.tsx` wraps `DonutChart`
and `TrendChart` in `next/dynamic` (`ssr: false`, with a skeleton), and
`CoverageBars` moved to its own file so it no longer drags recharts in. The
largest client chunk went from 597 KB to 372 KB; screens that draw no chart
no longer download the charting library.

**Router cache.** `experimental.staleTimes: { dynamic: 30, static: 180 }` in
`next.config.ts`: a visited route's payload stays in the client router cache
for 30 s, so Back/Forward and re-clicking a nav item paint instantly. Thirty
seconds keeps governance data from reading stale for long, and every
mutation goes through a server action that revalidates anyway.
`optimizePackageImports` covers `lucide-react` and `recharts`.

**Function region.** The Supabase project is in **ap-southeast-1**
(Singapore); Vercel's default function region is **iad1** (Virginia). Every
database round trip was crossing the Pacific. `vercel.json` now pins
`"regions": ["sin1"]`, which turns each ~270 ms trip into tens of
milliseconds. This is the single largest production win and it is
configuration, not code — it takes effect on the next deployment.

**Measured** with `scripts/measure-page-timings.mjs` (new, env-driven, kept
for before/after comparisons): every page 1,350 → ~560 ms TTFB; dashboard
first paint 3,117 → ~560 ms with panels streaming in behind it. The residual
560 ms is two database round trips from a container ~270 ms away from the
database; from `sin1` the same two trips are ~20–40 ms.

**Database, checked and left alone:** Supabase's performance advisors report
no missing indexes on the hot tables (`agents`, `tenant_memberships`,
`user_roles`, `risk_findings`, `runtime_events` are covered). The findings
it does list — thirteen unindexed foreign keys on rarely-queried
`created_by`/`reviewed_by` columns, `auth.<fn>()` re-evaluated per row in the
`notifications`/`notification_preferences` RLS policies, nineteen unused
indexes — are not on any page's critical path and belong to their owning
modules; recorded here for them.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and the full Playwright suite.

## 2026-09-18 — Organization picker removed from the page header

By user decision, the header's organization chip is gone. The shell had two
tenant-switching surfaces — the bordered chip in the page header and the
block pinned above the account panel at the foot of the navigation rail —
because the supplied design showed both; they opened the same menu and did
the same thing. The rail's block is now the one surface. It is present on
desktop (permanent rail) and on phones (the same rail as a drawer, via the
tab bar's "More"), so tenant switching is reachable at every width.

`WorkspaceSwitcher` lost its `variant` prop along with the dead "topbar"
branch, rather than keeping an unused rendering around. Nothing else
changed: the same `selectTenantAction`, the same membership list from
`getMyMemberships()`, the same "Create new organization" item.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and `shell`, `design-review`, `auth`
and `navigation-smoke` specs.

---

## 2026-09-18 — Help centre: user guide, FAQ and the ask-the-guide assistant

**Built** `/help` (inside the authenticated shell) plus a **Get Help** entry
in the account menu — `modules/ui/AccountPanel.tsx`, between Settings and
Appearance.

The guide content is **structured data**, not prose pages:
`modules/ui/help/content.ts` holds 23 sections (getting started, the
SHOULD/CAN/DID model, agents/contracts/discovery, integrations, effective
access, policies, runtime, findings, rogue detection, certification,
reports/audit/search, notifications, roles, SSO/sessions, AI provider keys,
tenancy, and 3 FAQ entries). The page renders them; the assistant retrieves
against them. One source, so an answer can never link to a section the page
does not render — enforced by an e2e test that walks every contents link and
asserts the anchor exists.

**Content rule applied throughout:** describe only what is actually built,
and say so where something is not. The AI section states plainly that the
platform-wide key is an environment variable with no admin screen yet; the
notifications section states email needs a configured provider and degrades
to in-app otherwise.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build, and `tests/e2e/help.spec.ts` — 11
passing against the running app as a seeded tenant admin (menu → guide
navigation, section and FAQ rendering, every contents anchor resolving, a
real assistant round trip linking the right section, a suggested question,
and an off-topic question). Screenshotted at 1000px.

**Deliberately not done:** no separate marketing/docs site, no per-section
deep links from domain screens back into the guide, and no search box over
the guide (the assistant covers that need). The guide is not yet part of the
nav rail — the account menu is its only entry point, as asked.

---

## 2026-09-18 — Real logo applied across the app, in light and dark pairs

**Supplied:** the WonderAgent logo as a single 2172×724 PNG on a white
background — badge + wordmark + "GOVERN. TRUST. ENABLE." tagline.

**Extracted** into `assets/brand/` (7 assets + a README documenting each).
Two things about the source made this more than a crop, both recorded there
because they will recur if the logo is ever re-supplied:

- The background is **near**-white (253–255, not 255), so keying on white
  left the whole image faintly opaque. Alpha instead comes from flood-filling
  the background inward from the image borders, which has the second benefit
  of keeping the white robot face and W strokes *inside* the badge opaque —
  a global white key would have punched holes through them.
- The letter "o" is kerned **behind** the badge (they overlap in x), so no
  vertical crop yields a clean mark. The mark keeps only the connected
  components whose mean saturation is ≥0.45 — the badge's measure 0.82–0.90,
  the letter's 0.24.

**Light/dark pairs.** The wordmark's "onder" is a dark neutral that all but
disappears on a dark surface. The dark variants recolour only the neutral
text (wordmark → `#ECEFF5`, tagline → `#9AA6BA`), split by saturation so the
badge and the blue/purple "Agent" are never touched. The mark needs no pair.

**New `modules/ui/Logo.tsx`** with three variants — `mark`, `lockup`,
`full` — sized by height, width following each asset's own ratio. The
theme-paired variants render both and let `.theme-light-only` /
`.theme-dark-only` show one, reusing the guards EXPERIENCE-P0-15 added for
the product screenshots (they mirror the token blocks, so the logo cannot
disagree with its surface).

**Applied to:** the auth screens (`AuthShell`, so sign-in, sign-up,
forgot-password and update-password all get it), the landing header and
footer, onboarding, and the nav rail. The rail takes the **mark** alone —
it stays dark in both themes, and the wordmark would have duplicated the
name already printed beside it. Also replaced `app/favicon.ico` and added
`app/icon.png` / `app/apple-icon.png` (the Apple tile on brand navy, since
iOS composites on an opaque square).

**One real constraint found:** the full lockup is 4.5:1, so at its natural
height it is wider than a 320px screen. Heights were set to 56px on the auth
and onboarding screens and every variant carries `h-auto max-w-full`, so a
narrow container scales it rather than overflowing.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint, build; `design-review.spec.ts` +
`welcome.spec.ts` 23/23 — which is the real check here, since it asserts
**zero horizontal overflow at all seven widths in both themes** and one h1
per screen (onboarding's visible heading became the logo, with an `sr-only`
h1 keeping the document outline intact). `auth.spec.ts` + `help.spec.ts`
37/38, the one failure being the long-standing `@example.com` GoTrue flake
unrelated to this work. vitest 295/295. Screenshotted sign-in (light), the
landing header (dark), the rail (light) and sign-up at 320px.

## 2026-09-18 — /help made public (no login required)

User request: make the help centre reachable with no session, and link it
from the landing page and everywhere else it makes sense.

**Moved** `app/(customer)/help/page.tsx` → `app/help/page.tsx` (URL
unchanged — route groups don't affect paths; `/help` was already the URL,
it just used to live inside the authenticated `(customer)` shell). Gave it
its own `app/help/layout.tsx`: logo, theme toggle, and an auth-aware CTA
("Back to app" when signed in, "Log in" / "Get started" when not) — calls
only `getSessionUser()` (returns null rather than redirecting), never
`getTenantContext()` or anything that assumes a membership, matching the
pattern `app/welcome/layout.tsx` already established for signed-out
rendering.

**proxy.ts**: added `/help` to `PUBLIC_PATHS` (no redirect to `/sign-in`
for an unauthenticated visitor) and `UNENFORCED_PATHS` (the idle/absolute
session-expiry clock doesn't run there, same as the other pre-auth pages).

**A security decision, made and recorded rather than asked about:** the
help assistant's endpoint (`POST /api/v1/help/ask`) previously 401'd with
no tenant. It now serves anonymous callers too, but **retrieval-only** —
`lib/ai/helpAnswer.ts` gained an exported `guideOnlyAnswer()` (extracted
from `answerHelpQuestion`'s own no-provider fallback, so both paths share
identical "guide doesn't cover it" copy) and the route calls it directly
when `ctx.tenantId` is null, skipping `resolveAiProviderKey` and any LLM
call entirely. Reasoning: an unauthenticated endpoint that can trigger a
paid AI provider call, with no tenant to attribute or rate-limit the spend
to, is an abuse/cost vector; retrieval already answers correctly and the
design was built to degrade to it gracefully (`source: "guide"`), so the
public assistant loses nothing but AI-phrased prose. A signed-in caller
with a tenant is unaffected — same behaviour as before. The assistant's
"no AI provider configured" copy was also generic-ized (dropped "for this
workspace", since an anonymous visitor has none) to
`HelpAssistant.tsx`.

**Links added**, everywhere a visitor plausibly wants help:
- `app/welcome/layout.tsx` — "Help" in the landing page's top nav.
- `app/welcome/page.tsx` — "Help" in the landing footer.
- `modules/ui/AuthShell.tsx` — a quiet "Need help?" link under the footer,
  shared by all four public auth screens (sign-in, sign-up,
  forgot-password, update-password) since they all render through it.
- `app/(customer)/layout.tsx` — the header's `CircleHelp` icon was labelled
  `aria-label="Help and reporting"` but linked to `/reports`; repointed it
  to `/help` (Reports already has its own sidebar nav entry, so nothing is
  stranded) and relabelled it `"Get Help"` to match what it now does.
- The account menu's existing "Get Help" → `/help` link (AccountPanel) is
  unchanged.

**Verified:** typecheck and lint clean. vitest 295/295 (helpAnswer.test.ts
20/20, unaffected by the refactor since `guideOnlyAnswer` reproduces the
exact same fallback logic `answerHelpQuestion` used inline before).
`npm run build` succeeds, `/help` compiles as its own dynamic route.
Rewrote `tests/e2e/help.spec.ts` into two describe blocks: a new "signed
out" one (6 tests — public reachability, the landing nav/footer link, the
sign-in "Need help?" link, guide rendering, the assistant answering
anonymously and retrieval-only, and the signed-out header CTAs) plus the
existing "signed in" block (8 tests, one new one for the header help icon)
kept intact. Ran `help.spec.ts` + `welcome.spec.ts` + `auth.spec.ts` +
`shell.spec.ts` together: 55/56 passed, the one failure
(`sign-up with a fresh, valid email…`) is the pre-existing GoTrue
email-rate-limit flake unrelated to this change (confirmed by rerunning
against `origin/main`'s same test file/line before this work started).
Screenshotted `/help` at desktop light, desktop dark and 390px mobile with
no session cookie at all (curled it directly too — `200`, not a redirect),
and the landing page's new top nav "Help" entry.

**Left out:** no rate limiting was added to the now-public
`/api/v1/help/ask` endpoint. Judged unnecessary for P0 because the
anonymous path never leaves the process (pure in-memory retrieval against
`GUIDE_SECTIONS`, no DB or external call) — there's no meaningful cost or
DB load for an attacker to run up. Flagged here rather than silently
skipped in case Operations Agent's abuse-monitoring work wants a floor on
it anyway.

## 2026-09-19 — Landing page contact details: real domain + a mailto CTA

Direct user request: replace the placeholder website address shown on the
landing page with the real one, and add an email contact as a CTA (not the
address printed in the clear).

**Website address** — the browser-chrome address bar shown above the three
product screenshots (`modules/ui/ProductShot.tsx`'s `BrowserFrame`) read
the placeholder `app.wonderagent.com`. Updated all three occurrences to
`agent.WonderApps.biz`: the component's own default (used by the hero
screenshot, `app/welcome/page.tsx`), and the two explicit overrides on the
Risk and Agents screenshots (`.../risk`, `.../agents`). `BrowserFrame` is
only ever used on this one page (confirmed via grep), so no other screen
needed touching.

**Email CTA** — added "Email us" to the landing footer
(`app/welcome/page.tsx`), a small outline pill `LinkButton` with a `Mail`
icon (lucide-react) next to the existing Help/Sign in/Get started links.
`href="mailto:connect@wonderapps.biz"` — the address itself is never
printed as visible text anywhere on the page, only inside the link target,
per the request ("no need to show the email fully on landing page").
Confirmed via a raw `curl`: the page's HTML contains the `mailto:` href
but the plain address string appears nowhere else in the rendered text.

Scoped to the landing page only (`/welcome` and its shared `ProductShot`
component) — the two places on the site that reference a domain or invite
contact — rather than also touching the auth screens or in-app shell,
which have no such placeholder today and weren't part of the request.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint clean. `npm run build` clean. Screenshotted
the footer in light, dark, and at 390px mobile width — the button wraps
cleanly with the other footer links at every width, no overflow. Live
`design-review.spec.ts` (12 cases: 0px horizontal overflow at all seven
tracked widths, both themes, plus structural checks) and `welcome.spec.ts`
(5 cases) both re-run against this change: 23/23 passing. Full vitest
suite unaffected (342/342, no unit test references the old placeholder
string).

## 2026-09-25 — Light-console redesign: shell, Dashboard, Agent inventory, Agent 360

**Trigger.** The user supplied the *WonderAgent Master P0/P1/P2
Implementation Stories* plus four boards of light-console mockups (12
product screens and 4 MCP screens). The master stories' own first step
(§14, §33) is a codebase map before any major change. That is
`docs/implementation/codebase-map.md`, written first in the same commit.
This entry covers the UI half.

**Shell (`modules/ui/AppSidebar.tsx`, `shell-nav.ts`, `AccountPanel.tsx`,
`app/(customer)/layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`)**

- The rail is now white. It had been fixed navy since 2026-09-18; the
  mockups supersede that. The `--sidebar*` tokens are themed again and are
  re-declared in both dark blocks.
- The nav is grouped into the master stories' ten sections: Dashboard,
  Discover, Agents, Access Intelligence, Governance, Runtime Protection,
  Risk & Investigations, Audit & Compliance, Integrations, Administration.
- The current section is a filled primary pill with `aria-current="true"`.
  Its sub-pages are listed beneath it on a hairline guide, and the current
  sub-page has `aria-current="page"`.
- Active state is now the longest matching prefix across sections, so
  `/agents/discovery` belongs to Discover and not Agents.
- **Only sub-pages with a real route are linked.** The mockups also show NHI
  Inventory, Shadow AI, MCP & Tools, Models, Runtime Gateway, JIT &
  Credentials, Emergency Controls and others. None of those exist, and a nav
  link to an empty shell would fabricate a capability. They are gaps in
  codebase-map §3.
- The account menu moved from the rail foot to the header (avatar, name,
  role, chevron), as in the mockups. The organization switcher stays at the
  rail foot (user decision, 2026-09-18). The rail is `sticky` at full height.
- Added a `--violet` token (light and dark), a WonderAgent extension beside
  success/warning/info, for the discovery/unregistered colour in the mockups.

**Shared primitives**

- `KpiCard` uses the mockup layout: icon tile on the left; label, number and
  change on the right. It gains an `emphasis` tint, a `violet` tone and
  `size="sm"`.
- `CountPills` gains `variant="tabs"`, an underline strip. It keeps radio
  semantics.
- `DataTable` gains a `toolbar` slot and `bare`.
- `TableContainer` gains `bare` for tables inside cards. Table headers are
  sentence case on a lighter band.
- `DonutChart` gains `showCounts`. `TrendChart` gains
  `variant="stacked-area"`.
- New `PeriodSelect`: a URL-driven period picker with a pending spinner.

**Dashboard (`app/(customer)/page.tsx`)**, rebuilt to mockup 1: "AI Agent
Security Overview".

- Five headline cards: Total, Approved, High-risk, Unregistered, and Failed
  actions (with the change against the previous period).
- An Agent lifecycle ring with count and share.
- A Risk trend: findings detected per day, stacked by severity, over the
  selected 7/30/90 days.
- A Recent agent activity table and a Top risky agents table.

It is one parallel wave of five queries. The per-agent posture fan-out, and
the Suspense streaming it needed, is gone from the dashboard, so
`dashboard-panels.tsx` and `Greeting.tsx` were deleted. Two mockup metrics
were **renamed to what the product can truthfully measure** (§17.5):

- "Shadow AI" became Unregistered (lifecycle DISCOVERED).
- "Blocked actions" became Failed actions (runtime events with
  `success = false`). Nothing is blocked at runtime until a Runtime Gateway
  exists (codebase-map §6.1).

Failed actions uses a new additive Runtime contract, `countRuntimeEvents()`,
a head-only count query. It is recorded in the Runtime audit log.

**Agent inventory (`app/(customer)/agents/page.tsx`, `AgentsTable.tsx`)**,
rebuilt to mockup 2.

- A six-card compact strip: Total, Active, Discovered, At risk, Mapped to
  owners, Unowned.
- One card holds underline tabs (All / At risk / Unowned / Discovered), then
  search with Status and Environment filters and an Export link (the Agent
  Inventory report).
- Columns: Name, Platform, Framework, Environment, Status, Risk (band and
  score), Findings, Owner, Last seen.
- Owner comes from Identity's bulk `listOwnersForTenant()`: one query, not
  one per agent.

**Agent 360 (`app/(customer)/agents/[id]/page.tsx`)**, rebuilt to mockup 3.

- A three-column grid at xl:
  - Agent information, now with owner *names* instead of user UUIDs.
  - Key metrics: applications, entitlements, data classifications and
    privileged grants, from `getEffectiveAccess()`.
  - Purpose & approved access: contract purpose and approved actions, then
    the effective grants `compareAccessToContract()` classes as excessive or
    unclassified.
  - Recent activity.
  - Risk summary: score band plus open findings by category.
  - Governance posture.
- The editing forms follow under a "Governance & configuration" heading.
- All reads are in one parallel wave.

**Deliberately not done this pass**

- Mockups 4–12 and the MCP boards: the Access graph, Policies, Runtime
  Gateway, Risk & Investigations, Audit & Compliance, Integrations catalog,
  Administration, Investigation detail, Authorization request, MCP servers,
  tools and mapping.
- Several of those depend on the PROTECT pillar and the new inventories,
  which are architecture decisions put to the user in codebase-map §6. The
  rest are UI restyles of existing pages and are the next Experience pass.
- `listAgents()` still has no server-side pagination (stopgap unchanged).

**Verified**

- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint` clean (exit 0); `npx vitest run`
  51 files / 352 tests passing.
- `next build` clean.
- **Full Playwright suite** (shared shell changed, §17.8): 140 / 141 passed.
  The one failure is `auth.spec.ts` "sign-up with a fresh, valid email":
  GoTrue answers `Email address "…@example.com" is invalid`. That is the
  existing, already-recorded provider validation issue on this project, and
  it is independent of this change.
- Specs updated for the new structure: `shell.spec.ts` (new sub-page case),
  `design-review.spec.ts` (the rail is now light in light mode and dark in
  dark mode), `agents.spec.ts` (tabs), and the Overview heading in
  `auth.spec.ts`, `auth.setup.ts`, `navigation-smoke.spec.ts` and
  `welcome.spec.ts`.
- Screenshots were compared against the mockups at 1440 px light, 1440 px
  dark and 390 px: Dashboard, Agents, Agent 360 and Administration. No
  horizontal overflow at 390 px (shell spec).

## 2026-09-25 — Responsive pass (user request: "make sure ui is responsive")

**Method.** A scripted sweep of 24 customer routes at seven widths (360,
390, 768, 834, 1024, 1280, 1440). The routes include Agent 360 and every
sub-page the automated design review had never visited. For each page it
recorded any page-level horizontal overflow and any table region wider than
its container. Screenshots were then taken at 360, 834, 1024 and 1440 px,
in light and dark mode.

**Found and fixed**

| Problem | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Page scrolled 265 px sideways at 360 px | Agent 360: the primary action bar sat in a `shrink-0` wrapper, so its buttons never wrapped | The bar is full-width (and wraps) below `xl`, and sits beside the title from `xl` (`max-w-[50%]`). Agent section tabs scroll inside their own strip |
| Agents table 1,346 px wide, scrolling sideways at every width from 768 to 1280 | `AgentsTable` | Column priority: Name, Status and Risk always; Owner and Findings from `xl`; Last seen, Platform, Framework and Environment from `2xl`. Name cell capped at 18 rem. Search still matches hidden fields |
| Audit table 940 px wide at 768–1280 px, and one stacked card too wide at 360 px | `/audit`: full ISO timestamps and full UUIDs | Timestamp shown as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (full value in `<time dateTime>`/title). Actor and object ids shortened to 8 characters, with the full id on hover, in the Actor ID filter and in the CSV export. The Object column drops out between `md` and `lg` |
| Roles table 739 px wide at 768/1024 px | `/settings/roles` assign form | The form wraps; the select is capped at 12 rem and has an accessible name |
| Dashboard activity table 9 px too wide at 1280 px | `/` | The Resource column is shown from `2xl` |
| **Every Tailwind border-colour utility was ignored app-wide** | `app/globals.css`: an *unlayered* `* { border-color: var(--border) }` outranked the layered utilities | Moved into `@layer base`. Inactive tabs no longer show grey underlines; tinted cards, active tabs, badges and hover rings now get the border colours they were written with |

**New primitive support.** `Th` and `Td` take `hideBelow="lg" | "xl" |
"2xl"`, and `DataTableColumn` has `hideBelow`. A low-priority column
leaves the table layout between `md` and that breakpoint. It still shows in
the stacked phone card below `md`, where every field has room. Stacked cell
values use `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, so a long unbroken id wraps inside a
360 px card.

**Guarded in CI.** `design-review.spec.ts` changes:

- A 360 px "small phone" width, now eight widths.
- Five more routes: `/agents/duplicates`, `/access/requests`,
  `/risk/rogue`, `/integrations/jobs`, `/settings/roles`.
- Agent 360, resolved from the list at run time.
- A new assertion: on `/`, `/agents`, `/audit` and `/settings/roles`, no
  table may scroll sideways at 768 px and up.

**Verified**

- `tsc` clean; `eslint` exit 0; `vitest` 352/352.
- The final sweep of `/`, `/agents`, `/audit` and `/settings/roles` at
  1024, 1280 and 1440 px found no overflow and no scrolling table. Earlier
  in this pass, the 24-route sweep found every other route clean at all
  seven widths.
- **Full Playwright suite: 141/142.** Every design-review case passed: all
  eight widths across 17 routes plus Agent 360, and the new table-fit
  assertion. The fresh sign-up test also passed this run.
- The one failure was the FinanceBot central scenario's final `resolved`
  assertion. Re-run alone it passed 3 of 3 (once, then `--repeat-each=2`).
  It fails only under the full suite's two-worker load, and it has failed
  intermittently at this same step before (see the QA log). Nothing this
  pass changed is on its path (CSS, table columns, audit formatting), so it
  is **handed to QA Agent as a timing flake to harden**: wait on the
  re-evaluation result rather than a fixed timeout. Per §17.8 this is not
  claimed as "known flaky, ignore". It is an open item.

## 2026-09-25 — Runtime page: "Authorization decisions" card (with RUNTIME-P0-15)

A card above the runtime activity stream lists the gateway's last 10
decisions: time, agent, action, target, decision and reason. Each
decision's badge is labelled in words ("Allow", "Allow, restricted",
"Needs approval", "Deny"), never by colour alone. An "observed" note shows
that nothing was enforced, so the screen never implies a block happened
(§17.5). The empty state says how agents call the gateway.

The card uses the shared `TableContainer` with column priorities (Target
from xl, Reason from lg) and is covered by the gateway E2E spec, including
its invisibility to another organization.

---

## 2026-09-25 — EXPERIENCE-P0-17: access wording, friendly label with the model term

User decision: screens say "Approved (SHOULD)", "Effective Access (CAN)",
"Observed (DID)" and "Current Request (NOW)". `CLAUDE.md` §9 and UI rules
§11 are unchanged; SHOULD/CAN/DID stay the model's terms.

**One source.** New `modules/ui/accessViews.ts` exports `ACCESS_VIEW` and
`ACCESS_VIEWS_COMPARED`, from the `modules/ui` barrel. Screens use it
rather than typing the labels, so they cannot drift.

**Where it applies:**

- **Runtime comparison** (`/runtime/agents/:id`):
  - the card title is "Approved (SHOULD) vs Effective Access (CAN) vs
    Observed (DID)", and the four columns use the constants;
  - the page subtitle and the activity card title use the labels;
  - "SHOULD undefined" became "No approved contract". The label wrapped
    inside the badge at 360 px, and the plain words say the same thing.
- **Runtime activity:** the page subtitle, and the drawer's link to the
  comparison.
- **Rogue agent detail:** the deviation card title, and its "no contract"
  badge.
- **Agent 360:** the effective-access panel, the "no contract" empty
  states, and the contract card title ("Agent contract — Approved
  (SHOULD)").
- **Access agent page:** the subtitle and the grants card title.
- **Other screens:** the AI settings copy, the help centre (the model
  article's title, summary and definitions, and the Effective Access and
  Runtime article titles) and a help-assistant suggested question.
- **Welcome page:** the capability cards, the three model columns and the
  finding sentence.
- **Pipeline diagram (`FlowDiagram`):** the label now sits over its model
  term. At 1280 px the longer terms truncated "Agent contract" and "IAM
  entitlements" to "Agent …" and "I…", which was caught on the
  screenshot.
- **The evidence pack PDF** section heading and lines.

**Deliberately unchanged:**

- The agent section tabs "Access (CAN)" and "Runtime (DID)". They already
  pair a friendly word with the model term, and they name module pages,
  not the views.
- Code comments, API field names and the AI prompt text in
  `lib/ai/summarize.ts`. None are screens.

**Verified:**

- `tsc` and `eslint` clean; vitest 536/536.
- Affected specs (help, access, runtime, risk, design-review, welcome,
  agents): 55/55 after updating three assertions to the new wording
  (`help.spec` heading, `runtime.spec` heading plus the NOW column,
  `access.spec` heading by role).
- Screenshots: runtime comparison at 360 px (no horizontal overflow);
  welcome model columns at 360 px; pipeline diagram at 360, 768 and
  1280 px (no overflow, no truncation). Colours are tokens, so dark mode
  is unaffected.
- Full Playwright suite: **194/194** (9.3 min, fresh build).

## 2026-09-25 — Demo data seeded into WonderArk (user request: "seed initial data in WonderAgent")

**What.** New `scripts/seed-demo-data.mjs`, also `npm run seed:demo --
--tenant <slug> [--gateway <app url>]`. It seeds one organization with a
coherent dataset that exercises every module. Run against **WonderArk**
(`wonderark-34lm15`), the primary organization, whose welcome banner
already says the data is seeded but whose newer screens were empty.

**How it behaves:**

- **One organization only.** It resolves the tenant by slug, and every
  row carries that tenant's id (§14).
- **Idempotent and additive.** Everything is found by a natural key
  before it is created. A re-run reports "nothing new". Existing agents
  are reused untouched; the only change to an existing row is linking an
  entitlement that has no data source.
- **Gateway decisions are real.** With `--gateway`, the script mints an
  agent key per agent and sends requests to the app's own Runtime
  Gateway. Decisions, timeline events and audit rows are the engine's
  output. Fixed request ids make a re-run a replay. Each run rotates the
  demo key: the previous one is revoked.
- **The run is recorded** as a `demo.data_seeded` audit event (#11).
- **It reads the service-role key from `.env.local`** and never prints it.

**What WonderArk now holds:**

- **Agents:** 10 in total. New: ITOpsRunbookAgent (critical, a
  destructive MCP permission), ProcurementCopilot (no technical owner),
  CodeReviewAgent (unapproved merges, a shared credential),
  InvoiceReconciler (APPROVED, with a delegated owner) and
  SalesForecastAgent (REGISTERED, no contract yet). Each has lifecycle
  history, owners, contracts using the IDENTITY-P0-13 fields, identities
  and relationships.
- **Access:** 9 data sources, linked to entitlements, plus new
  entitlements, accounts and grants.
- **Integrations:** two MCP servers (finance-mcp, itops-mcp) with 7
  classified tools and resources.
- **Runtime:** 302 runtime events over 14 days, some failed; 24 real
  gateway decisions (ALLOW, REQUIRE_APPROVAL and DENY); two Shadow AI
  agents.
- **Risk and governance:**
  - 4 runtime policies with ACCESS-P0-12 targets and priorities (one a
    draft);
  - 5 findings with evidence, dated across the past three weeks;
  - two investigations (INV-2026-001 and INV-2026-002);
  - a privileged-access certification campaign;
  - 3 control mappings.

**Two product defects the data exposed, both fixed:**

- **Agent 360's recent activity labelled every event by `success`.** A
  gateway decision is a decision, not an action, so a denied `delete_vm`
  showed as "Succeeded" (§17.5). Decision events now show their decision
  ("Deny (observed)", "Needs approval (observed)", …), as the runtime
  page already does. Real actions keep Succeeded or Failed.
- **Agent 360's lifecycle history printed raw ISO timestamps.** It now
  shows `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.

**Adjustments made while seeding:**

- **Contracts.** The first gateway pass showed no ALLOW at all:
  - the older FinanceBot and CustomerSupportBot contracts are at autonomy
    level 0 (a human performs every action), so they are denied
    everything. They are left as they are, since the script does not
    modify existing data;
  - ITOpsRunbookAgent's autonomy was 2, so every request needed approval.
    It is now 3;
  - CodeReviewAgent's contract maximum was medium, below its risk score.
    It is now high.
  - The last two changes were made only to contracts this seed had just
    created. The script now writes these values. The decisions from the
    first pass remain as history.
- **Control mappings** are now keyed by policy, after a re-run had
  created three duplicates (deleted).

**Verified:**

- A throwaway organization and admin (deleted afterwards, confirmed
  gone) were seeded the same way and screenshotted at 1280 px: dashboard,
  agents, data sources, MCP servers, runtime, policies, risk,
  investigations, Shadow AI and Agent 360. There were no error
  boundaries. The real account holder was never signed in as.
- `tsc` and `eslint` clean.
- Playwright agents, design-review, runtime-gateway and
  ownership-contract specs: 42/42.

## 2026-09-26 — EXPERIENCE-P0-18: WonderID brand and dark navy navigation shell

The user decided (2026-09-26, recorded in `CLAUDE.md`) to rename the product
WonderID in the app and to replace the light-console rail of EXPERIENCE-P0-15
with the dark navy sidebar of the WonderID mockups
(`docs/requirements/wonderid-*.png`).

### Navigation

- **Information architecture** (`modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`):
  - the spec's section order: Home, Identities, Applications, Access
    Governance, Certifications, Governance & Policies, Risk & Security, AI
    Agents, Authentication, Insights, Integrations, Permissions (WonderID),
    Administration;
  - three levels: section → page, or section → group → page;
  - every existing route is listed exactly once, so exactly one page is
    current;
  - My Access and Workflows & Automation are omitted until they have
    pages, per the spec's "do not expose menu items whose underlying
    capability is not implemented". Each WonderID story adds its pages in
    the same commit.
- **Sidebar** (`modules/ui/AppSidebar.tsx`), one body in three modes:
  - **Expanded:** an accordion. The current section opens by itself and
    any section opens on click; groups nest inline, each collapsible.
  - **Collapsed:** an icon rail. Sections open a flyout on hover, click or
    keyboard (Radix DropdownMenu), and a group opens a third-level
    flyout. A red dot marks a section with a count.
  - **Below `lg`:** the same accordion in the drawer opened from the tab
    bar's "More".
- **Collapse is remembered** in the `wa_nav` cookie, which the layout
  reads so the server renders the right width.
- **Bug caught by the spec.** The cookie constant was first exported from
  the `"use client"` sidebar. Imported into the Server Component layout, it
  arrived as a client reference, not the string, so the setting was never
  read. It now lives in `shell-nav.ts`.
- **Foot of the sidebar:** a "WonderID AI" entry that promises only what
  exists ("Ask a question", the help assistant; the full assistant is
  EXPERIENCE-P0-20), and the organization switcher, which gained a compact
  form for the icon rail.
- **Tokens:** `--sidebar*` are navy in both themes. New tokens are
  `--sidebar-primary` (the active section pill), `--sidebar-primary-
  foreground` and `--sidebar-ring`; content tokens are unchanged.

### Brand

- `Logo` draws the WonderID W as inline SVG: two strokes and their lighter
  overlap. It uses solid colours, because an id-referenced gradient breaks
  when its first instance is hidden. The wordmark is live text, and the
  tagline is "Govern every identity. Verify every access."
- New `app/icon.png`, `apple-icon.png` and `favicon.ico`, rendered from
  the same SVG with the bundled Chromium.
- User-visible "WonderAgent" is now "WonderID" throughout: sign-in and
  sign-up, the help centre, settings copy, the welcome page, the
  platform-admin header, page titles, the MCP client name and the help
  assistant prompt.
- The help centre's "What WonderAgent is" article is rewritten as "What
  WonderID is". It had said the product is "deliberately not a replacement
  for your IAM, IGA", which is no longer true, and it now states what
  exists today (AI agent governance) versus what is being added.
- The welcome page hero now uses the WonderID tagline. Breadcrumb roots
  say "Home".
- The global announcement's text was updated in the database (see the
  Platform audit log).

### Tests

- `shell.spec` was rewritten for the new navigation:
  - the current page;
  - the auto-opened current section;
  - a page inside a group;
  - collapsed flyout → third-level flyout → navigation, with the choice
    remembered across a reload;
  - the mobile drawer.
- `design-review` now asserts that the sidebar is navy in both themes.
- `welcome` and `help` specs use the new brand strings.

### Verified

- tsc and eslint clean.
- Shell, design-review, welcome, help and navigation-smoke specs pass.
- Screenshots at 1440 px (expanded, collapsed with a third-level flyout,
  dark) and 390 px (drawer).
- Full Playwright suite (§17.8, the shell changed): **202/202 passed**
  (9.5 min).

## 2026-09-26 — Collapsed sidebar: a click no longer shuts a flyout that hover opened

Found by the full suite for INTEGRATION-P0-08/09.
`shell.spec`'s "collapsed … third-level flyout" test failed once in 222.

**Cause:** a race between two handlers. Moving the mouse onto a section's
icon opens its flyout (hover). The press that follows then reached
Radix's trigger, which toggles, so the flyout closed again. Whether a
user saw it open depended on timing.

**Fix:** in `AppSidebar.tsx`'s `CollapsedSection`, a primary mouse press on
the trigger now always opens (`preventDefault` on Radix's toggle). The
keyboard keeps Radix's Enter/Space toggle, and leaving the section still
closes the flyout.

**Verified:** `shell.spec` **41/41** over `--repeat-each=5`; tsc and eslint
clean.

## 2026-09-26 — EXPERIENCE-P0-22/23: WonderID brand foundation, shell and sign-in (Phase 4c)

Source: the user-supplied
`docs/requirements/WonderID_Branding_Application_Wide_Implementation_Requirements.md`
and its brand sheet, `docs/requirements/wonderid-brand-sheet.png`. The plan
and the decisions below are in `docs/plan/WONDERID-ROADMAP.md` § Phase 4c.

**EXPERIENCE-P0-22: brand foundation (BRAND-001/002/003/006).**

- **Assets.** `public/brand/` holds the specification's set (§8):
  - `logo/`: the lockup for light and dark backgrounds, monochrome dark and
    light, the tagline lockups, and the mark with its variants;
  - `favicon/`: 16, 32, 48 and Apple touch;
  - `social/`: the Open Graph image.

  `app/favicon.ico`, `icon.png` and `apple-icon.png` come from the same
  source.
- **The user's own artwork** (user instruction, 2026-09-26: "just use the
  attached images"). `scripts/brand/extract-assets.py` cuts every asset
  from the supplied `docs/requirements/wonderid-brand-sheet.png`. It
  redraws nothing: it removes each panel's flat background (colour to
  alpha against that panel's exact colour), blanks the tagline for the
  plain lockups, and resamples the icon sizes. The results were checked
  on white, the app's grey and navy with no halo. A first pass had
  redrawn the mark and outlined the wordmark from Geist; it was removed
  before release. The files are PNG at the sheet's resolution. Official
  vector files, when supplied, replace them.
- **Configuration.** `modules/ui/brand.ts` (`wonderIdBrand`, `brandTitle`)
  is the only brand configuration: name, tagline, statement, descriptor,
  palette, chart sequence, and asset paths with intrinsic sizes (from the
  generated `brandAssets.generated.json`).
- **Tokens.**
  - `--brand-navy/blue/sky/violet/slate/mist` and `brand-*` utilities;
  - `--primary`, `--ring` and `--accent-foreground` are now Electric Blue
    (6.8:1 against white text), with a lifted tint in dark mode;
  - the sidebar is Deep Navy with an Electric Blue active pill;
  - status colours are unchanged, and `--violet` stays the text-safe AI
    tone: brand Violet is 4.2:1 on white.
  - Deliberately not token-mapped: the whole page background. The current
    gray-blue already matches Mist's role, and the specification forbids a
    wholesale colour replacement (§72).
- **Components** (`modules/ui/Logo.tsx`):
  - `<WonderIDLogo variant size showWordmark showTagline alt priority />`
    is a Server Component. It renders only the brand's own assets, sets
    width and height from the manifest (no layout shift), and pairs light
    and dark artwork on themed surfaces through `.theme-light-only` /
    `.theme-dark-only`.
  - `<TenantLogo name />`, kept separate: the organization's initials,
    since tenants have no uploaded logo yet.
  - The old inline-SVG `Logo` and `WONDERID_TAGLINE` are gone; all six call
    sites were moved over.

**EXPERIENCE-P0-23: shell and authentication (BRAND-004/005).**

- Sidebar: the dark-surface lockup. Collapsed, it shows the W mark, and
  the mark is the "Expand navigation" control. Before, the collapsed rail
  showed no brand at all.
- Below `lg` the header carries the W mark (link "WonderID home").
- Sign-in and sign-up: the tagline lockup and "Secure access for every
  identity." On an organization's address the page reads "Sign in to your
  organization", with the organization's `TenantLogo` and "Secure access
  powered by WonderID". Onboarding uses the tagline lockup.
- Titles (§16–18):
  - root: `WonderID · %s`, defaulting to "WonderID · AI Identity Security";
  - the customer layout: `<Organization> · %s · WonderID` (request-cached,
    no extra query);
  - sign-in: "<Organization> · Sign in · WonderID" on a tenant address;
  - the public pages' titles were shortened to fit the template.
- The favicon link is the SVG mark; the Open Graph image is set.
- `proxy.ts`'s matcher skips `/brand/`, `/icon.png` and `/apple-icon.png`.
  Before this, a signed-out visitor's request for a logo would have been
  redirected to sign-in.

**Verified:** see the next entry.

**Left out / handed on:**

- EXPERIENCE-P0-24: the chart palette, per-page titles, W-mark empty,
  loading, error and 404 states, permission chips.
- The rest of EXPERIENCE-P0-25's baselines.
- Operations P1: BRAND-010 e-mail and BRAND-011 reports and evidence.
- PLATFORM-P0-14: the platform console's "Product name" setting, which
  overlaps the single brand configuration (§71); and the platform console,
  still unstyled scaffolding.
- **For the user:**
  - the sheet image prints #081220 and #2563FF where the text says #08122C
    and #2538FF; the text was used;
  - official vector logo files are still needed;
  - the specification's light console versus the chosen navy sidebar:
    navy kept (Phase 4b decision 5).

## 2026-09-26 — Branding follow-ups: the supplied artwork, the light console, verification

1. **The user's own artwork** (user instruction: "just use the attached
   images"). The logos, marks, icons and social image are cut from the
   supplied brand sheet by `scripts/brand/extract-assets.py`; nothing is
   redrawn. The redrawn first pass and its generator were removed before
   release. See the entry above.
2. **The light console** (user decision: "go ahead with branding document
   suggestion"):
   - The sidebar follows the branding specification instead of the navy
     rail of EXPERIENCE-P0-18:
     - white in light mode, with a hairline border;
     - active items in Electric Blue on a soft blue tint (§26);
     - the full-colour logo, theme-paired;
     - a dark surface in dark mode.
   - Only the `--sidebar*` tokens changed (both themes) and the rail's
     logo variant; no component was forked.
   - CLAUDE.md §13, the roadmap decisions (Phase 4b decision 5, Phase 4c
     decision 4) and the design-review spec ("the sidebar follows the
     theme") are updated.
   - The account menu and onboarding now use the role display names
     ("Tenant Administrator").

**Verified:**

- The branding spec, with the sign-in desktop and mobile screenshot
  baselines, and the design-review spec: 34 passed on the light-console
  build.
- The earlier combined run (navy build) is recorded in the Foundation
  audit.
- Screenshots: Home in light and dark (1440).
- The full suite on the final build is recorded in the next entry.

## 2026-09-26 — Full suite on the light console build (741aabf)

- 310 passed. 16 failed or did not run, all in one ten-minute window when
  the server could not reach Supabase (`fetch failed`), so sessions read
  as signed out.
- Re-running the five affected specs against the same build: 54/54 passed,
  including design-review's structure, theming and mobile tab-target
  checks.
- Details are in the Foundation audit.

## 2026-09-26 — Landing page and Get Help brought up to date (user request)

**Why:** both pages still described the product as agent-only. The landing
page also called WonderID "not a replacement IAM, IGA, PAM or SIEM", which
contradicts the adopted WonderID scope (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #7). The
help guide pointed to menu paths that no longer exist, said "WonderID grew
out of WonderID", and covered none of the features shipped since Phase 1.

**Landing page (`/welcome`):**

- The description and platform section now cover every identity type.
  WonderID is described as not an IdP, PAM vault or SIEM; the IdP and
  HR/directory systems remain the systems of record.
- Nine capability cards:
  - identities;
  - AI agents;
  - applications and accounts;
  - access requests and packages;
  - Effective Access (CAN);
  - runtime (gateway and emergency controls);
  - risk and investigations;
  - certification;
  - administration.
- A new "What's new" section with six recent releases:
  - scoped roles and authorization policies;
  - users, groups and custom roles;
  - access requests, approvals and packages;
  - application onboarding and account inventory;
  - identity sources and lifecycle;
  - tenant sign-in addresses.
- "How it works" now describes connect → govern → control access →
  detect, certify, remediate. The closing call to action and the footer
  tagline were updated.
- Header nav trimmed to five items: The solution, Platform, What's new,
  How it works, Help. At 1440px the seven-item version had wrapped.

**Get Help (`/help`, `modules/ui/help/content.ts`):**

- Rewritten around the current product: 41 sections in 14 categories.
  New sections:
  - finding your way around;
  - the identity directory;
  - joiners, movers and leavers;
  - authoritative identity sources;
  - agent API keys;
  - applications and onboarding;
  - accounts and data sources;
  - requesting and approving access;
  - access packages;
  - the Runtime Gateway;
  - emergency controls;
  - investigations;
  - users and membership;
  - groups;
  - scoped and time-limited role assignments;
  - authorization policies;
  - the organization's sign-in address;
  - "Why can't I see a page or button?".
- Existing sections were updated to current menu paths and behaviour.
  Section ids and titles the assistant and tests rely on are unchanged.
- Features still in progress are described as in progress:
  - organization-wide MFA enforcement;
  - certification of people's access;
  - require-approval routing.
- A "What's new" panel links to the new sections. The assistant's
  suggested questions gain "How do I invite a user?" and "Can I limit a
  role to production?".

**Verified:**

- tsc and eslint clean.
- vitest `lib/ai`: 20/20. The deterministic retrieval tests are unchanged
  and passing.
- A spot check of 15 new questions landed each one on the right section.
- Production build succeeds.
- Playwright help, welcome, design-review and branding specs: 53/53. The
  first run caught a duplicate "Govern every identity" heading; the step
  was renamed "Give every identity an owner".
- Screenshots: landing platform section (light, 1440); What's new (dark,
  390); help (light, 1440); header at 1024 and 1440.

**Left out:** the product screenshots on the landing page are the existing
agent-centric captures. New captures of the identity and administration
screens can follow when those screens are next restyled.

---

## 2026-10-01 — Landing page, Get Help and navigation for billing, privacy, audit integrity and security

User request: highlight Razorpay/Stripe, GDPR/DPDP, SOX/financial compliance
and IT security on the landing page.

- `/welcome` has a new "Trust & compliance" section (`#trust`, linked from the
  header nav). It has four cards, each with concrete, true-to-code points:
  payments, privacy, financial compliance and security.
- There is a compliance chip row in the hero, and three new "What's new"
  items. The copy says WonderID provides controls and evidence, never
  "compliant" (CLAUDE.md §10 item 10).
- Get Help (`modules/ui/help/content.ts`) has four new sections: billing,
  privacy, my-privacy and audit-integrity.
- Sidebar:
  - Administration gains Billing.
  - Governance & Policies gains Privacy & Data Protection and Audit Integrity.
  - The account menu gains My privacy.
  - The Administration index links all four.

**Verification.**
- A built server was screenshotted in Chromium at 1440 px light and dark, and
  at 390 px light. There is no horizontal overflow, the cards stack on mobile,
  and the tokens render in both themes.
- eslint is clean and `next build` passes.
- The new app screens (billing, privacy, my-privacy, audit integrity) reuse
  `modules/ui` primitives. They were not screenshotted with a signed-in session
  in this sandbox; the §32 review at seven widths is open for those screens.

---

## 2026-10-01 — Landing page repositioned as IGA for human and non-human identities

User request: say the product is IGA for human and non-human identities,
describe all its main features, and highlight the security, privacy and
compliance built into the product.

- **Hero.** The label now reads "Identity Governance & Administration". The
  lede says WonderID is IGA for human and non-human identities. Two chip rows
  were added: the four identity types (workforce and external are human;
  machine and AI agents are non-human) and the compliance frameworks.
- **New `#identities` section.** Four identity-type cards (workforce, external,
  machine, AI agents), each saying what WonderID governs for that type, plus a
  strip showing one lifecycle for every type (discover through offboard).
- **Problem section.** Broadened from agents only to every identity type: an
  unowned service account, a leaver contractor whose accounts stayed open, and
  an agent at night.
- **SHOULD/CAN/DID section.** Now labelled "Beyond classic IGA", framed as what
  non-human identities need on top of classic IGA. The heading the E2E suite
  asserts is unchanged.
- **`#platform` section.** Replaced by nine feature groups, each with concrete
  points: identity lifecycle, applications & accounts, access requests,
  effective access, certification, policy & administration, risk & detection,
  runtime assurance, insights & operations.
- **New `#security` section, "Security is the architecture".** Nine controls:
  RLS tenant isolation, rules not AI, human approval with database-enforced
  four-eyes, the hash-chained audit trail, SSO/MFA/sessions, AES-256-GCM
  secrets, read-only connectors, runtime containment, and a hardened
  web/supply chain.
- **`#trust` section, now "Privacy & compliance".**
  - The cards are privacy (GDPR/DPDP), financial compliance (SOX), security &
    AI governance (ISO 27001, SOC 2, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, NIST CSF) and
    payments.
  - A list of the 16 included control libraries was added.
  - An explicit disclaimer says mappings are evidence, not certification
    (CLAUDE.md §10 item 10).
- **Other copy.**
  - The header nav is now Identities · Platform · Security · Compliance · How
    it works · Help. "Log in" no longer wraps.
  - "What's new" is trimmed to six items.
  - The metadata and footer tagline were updated.
- **Accuracy.** Every claim was checked against shipped code, the sidebar
  routes, the Get Help content and the seeded `control_frameworks` (0105 and
  earlier). No feature that does not exist is advertised.

**Verification.**
- `tsc --noEmit` reports 0 errors, eslint is clean, and `next build` passes.
- The built server was driven in Chromium at 1440, 1280, 1024, 768, 390 and
  320 px, light and dark: horizontal overflow was 0 at every width.
- The first pass overflowed by 19 px at 1024 px (the header nav). It was fixed
  by shortening "Privacy & compliance" to "Compliance" in the nav and adding
  `whitespace-nowrap` to "Log in", then re-checked.
- Screenshots of the hero, identities, platform, security and trust sections
  were reviewed in both themes.
- A scripted check covered what `welcome.spec.ts` asserts: the h1 "Govern every
  identity", the "Close the gap…" heading, and "Get started" → /sign-up and
  "Sign in" → /sign-in. It also found no duplicate ids and no empty headings,
  and the server log had no errors.
- The full Playwright suite was not re-run: the change is copy and layout on
  the public page only, with no shared infrastructure touched (§17.8 list).

## 2026-10-08 — Get Help checked against the code and brought up to date (founder request)

User request: update the Get Help page to match the latest features. No
backlog story: like the 2026-09-26 and 2026-10-01 refreshes, this is a copy
and documentation change, so no Progress Tracker row moves.

**Method.** Every statement in `modules/ui/help/content.ts` was read against
the screen or service it describes (the sidebar in `shell-nav.ts`, each
route's page, and the rule modules behind them). Statements the code did not
support were corrected or removed; capabilities with no help were added.

**Statements that were no longer true, now corrected.**
- Agent lifecycle named a "proposed" state. The states are Discovered,
  Registered, Assessed, Approved, Provisioned, Active, Certification due,
  Restricted, Suspended and Retired, with role and contract preconditions.
- Identity page "shows the access it holds". It shows details, relationships,
  attributes and (for people) the lifecycle; access is on the agent's Access tab.
- Non-human Identities "lists service accounts and keys with owner and expiry".
  It is the connector-reported inventory with Linked, Not linked, Likely AI
  agents, Orphaned and Ignored views and no expiry column.
- Certification decisions were "certify, flag or revoke" with a campaign
  "evidence pack". They are Approve, Revoke, Modify, Delegate and Request
  information. The campaign evidence export and the per-agent PDF evidence pack
  exist only as API routes, with no button, so Reports now lists the eight
  reports that do have CSV export and the pack is no longer promised.
- Request policies "decide who approves (manager, entitlement owner,
  application owner, access managers)", and a separation-of-duties conflict
  "is shown before anyone approves". Routes are manager, owner, or manager and
  owner; a critical-risk request adds an access-manager review. Separation of
  duties is an identity-category policy that applies to agent access requests
  and grants and refuses at the time of the action; it is now described there.
- Contracts had a "completeness score". The agent page has a governance posture
  score (twelve dimensions); the contract is versioned and can expire.
- "Revoke all keys" was placed in the runtime emergency controls. It is on the
  agent's API keys panel; the Runtime card has the kill switch, tool and MCP
  server suspension and session termination.
- Notifications "controls which events reach you". All eleven types are
  mandatory; the page shows them locked on.
- Data sources "link to applications". They link to entitlements.
- Pending Matches "confirm or reject" uncertain matches. The page is for source
  records that match more than one identity: link, create new or dismiss.
- Rogue detection listed "unapproved access"; access-scope findings are
  excluded from it.
- Search covered "agents, identities, findings and policies"; it covers eleven
  object kinds filtered by permission, and not the people in the directory.
- Sign-in said Google, Microsoft and LinkedIn "are available". The 2026-10-02
  Foundation audit entry found all three providers disabled in the production
  project, and the buttons say so when clicked. Help now says each works only
  once that provider is enabled, and that organization addresses offer password
  and SSO only (as `SignInForm` does).
- The words "database" and "row-level security" are gone from user-facing text.
- "Formerly WonderAgent" now appears once (What WonderID is); the guide had no
  other stale product name.

**Added.** The Home overview; agent lifecycle and approval; the Current Request
(NOW) view; manual agent registration, duplicate handling and the agent page's
tabs; owner types and ownership gaps; new identity and the Overview's attention
list; person lifecycle steps and the tasks each event opens; identity-source
setup, full/partial/preview imports and runs; application onboarding step by
step with proposals; application discovery; account views; effective access on
the Access tab; request policy terms, statuses and the three request views;
access package management and direct assignment; policy categories, actions,
draft/publish and exceptions; gateway decisions and observe-only; finding
workflow and resolution types; investigations; certification scopes and
decisions; connector pages; reports and audit filters; the user wizard
(invite or add now); two FAQ entries (troubleshooting, how the assistant
works); and a "Still need help?" block on `/help` with the landing page's
existing `mailto:` link (address not printed, as there). "What's new" now leads
with billing, privacy and audit integrity. The `birthright` retrieval keyword
was dropped (no such concept in the product).

**Tests.** New `modules/ui/help/content.test.ts` (unique ids, no empty
sections, current lifecycle states, no internal technology names, one
historical use of the old name, no invented contact address or promise).
`lib/ai/helpAnswer.test.ts` gains retrieval cases for the new sections.
`tests/e2e/help.spec.ts` gains checks for the new sections, the contact link,
the social sign-in wording and a suggested question.

**Verification.** `npx next typegen` then `npm run typecheck` (0 errors),
`npm run lint` (clean), `npm test` (105 files, 825 tests passed). `/help` was
rendered by a local `next dev` with placeholder environment variables and no
network to any service: the new sections, "What's new" items and the mailto
link are present and no `@` appears in the page text. The Playwright help spec
was not run: its global setup seeds tenants through the service-role key, which
this sandbox does not have (and must not use).

**Left for the owner (not changed here).**
- Social sign-in is still off and, per the 2026-10-02 audit, the redirect
  allow-list does not include `agent.wonderapps.biz`, which also affects the
  emailed password-reset link. Help describes the screens truthfully either
  way; it does not fix either.
- SSO's end-to-end handshake is still unverified (FOUNDATION-P0-03.3 Partial).
- `public/.well-known/security.txt` still carries the placeholder
  `security@wonderid.example`.
- The campaign evidence package and the governance evidence pack have no UI.

## 2026-10-09 — Landing page: pricing, non-human identities, identity and administration screenshots (user requests)

**What changed** (`app/welcome/*`):

- **Pricing** (`#pricing`, new `app/welcome/Pricing.tsx`, header link
  "Pricing"):
  - Free, Pro, Max and Enterprise, with a monthly/yearly switch and USD,
    EUR or INR.
  - Prices are the billing catalogue's own rows, the same ones checkout
    charges, read by Platform's new `listPublicPrices()`. Limits come
    from `PLAN_DEFAULTS`, the same values billing enforces.
  - Yearly prices show "About X a month, billed yearly" and the computed
    saving. USD and EUR say "plus applicable tax"; INR says "incl. GST".
  - The page is static and re-read hourly (`revalidate = 3600`), so a
    price changed in the console appears within the hour.
  - If the catalogue can't be read, no price is shown ("Contact us for
    pricing") and the error is logged.
  - The section states, truthfully, that every plan includes the whole
    product and plans differ only in scale and audit retention. No
    feature is plan-gated in the code.
  - Enterprise is "Custom" with a mailto (the footer's pattern; the
    address is never printed).
- **Non-human identities (NHI):** a dedicated panel (`#nhi`) inside the
  identities section, with its own screenshot of the NHI inventory and six
  shipped capabilities:
  - one inventory of service accounts, workloads, OAuth clients, API keys
    and MCP server identities;
  - links to the agent or account each runs as, with agent likelihood;
  - an owner on each, with orphaned and privileged ones flagged;
  - governed rotation and expiry, with no secrets stored;
  - Shadow AI;
  - the same certifications, risk scoring and audit trail as people.
- **Screenshots replaced:** the agent-centric overview, risk and agent
  shots are gone. The hero is now the Identities overview, desktop and
  phone. "Inside the product" is a 2×2 grid, each shot with new copy:
  - the All identities directory;
  - Users;
  - Roles;
  - Authorization policies.
- **Header:** "Compliance" and "How it works" show from xl up only, so the
  header fits at 1024px. At 1024 the seven-item nav cut off "Get started".

**Demo data** (Northwind Financial, kept for screenshots by the user's
2026-09-17 decision):

- New `scripts/seed-showcase-identity.mjs`. It is idempotent, scoped to
  one tenant, and fills only empty values. It added:
  - job titles for the four members;
  - seven more people, one of them leaving;
  - two external identities with a sponsor and end date;
  - three service accounts with an owner, two of them privileged;
  - the groups Finance Operations and Security Engineering;
  - the custom role Finance Reviewer;
  - Priya Nair's Agent Administrator role, scoped to production with a
    90-day expiry and MFA;
  - the policy "Production agents are never deleted".
- A second run added nothing.
- Capture: `ava.chen@northwind.example`'s password was reset through the
  service-role admin API, as on 2026-09-17. The new random password was
  passed only through the environment of the capture run, never printed,
  stored or committed.
- `scripts/capture-landing-shots.mjs` now:
  - captures the new screens;
  - fills the password by `#password`, because the "Show password" button
    shares the label;
  - hides the global announcement banner with a style injected into the
    capture browser only. The live announcement is never changed. The
    banner root gained `data-slot="announcements"` for this.

**Also fixed:** the sign-in visual baseline (desktop and mobile) was
regenerated. `da1b565` on main added Microsoft and LinkedIn buttons
without updating it, so the branding spec failed: the page is 872px tall
against the 800px baseline. The new rendering was reviewed; the only
difference is the two buttons.

**Verified:**

- tsc and eslint clean; vitest 825/825.
- Production build: `/welcome` is static, with a 1-hour revalidate.
- Playwright welcome, help, design-review, branding and shell specs:
  66 run, 65 passed. The one failure was the stale sign-in baseline; after
  regenerating it, branding passes 12/12.
- Two new welcome tests:
  - pricing renders catalogue prices for monthly, yearly and INR with
    GST, limits from the plan definitions, and the CTA targets;
  - the NHI panel and all four product-shot headings render.
- Screenshots reviewed: pricing (light monthly USD; dark yearly USD;
  yearly INR), the NHI panel, the product grid (dark), and the header at
  1024 and 1440.
- No horizontal overflow at 390 or 1440.

## 2026-10-10 — Actions menu (CSV export and import) on every object list page

User requirement: every object page gets an action drop-down with import and
export. What changed:

- `modules/ui/ObjectActionsMenu.tsx`: a Radix DropdownMenu with an outline
  "Actions" trigger, placed in the page header next to the primary action.
  It is the only new control on each page, and it renders nothing when the
  viewer has no item. Its items come from Operations'
  `objectActionsFor()`:
  - "Export CSV", when the viewer has the page's read permission and
    `report.export`;
  - "Import CSV…", for identity, account, entitlement, access_grant and
    application, when the viewer has `integration.execute`.
- Import opens a Radix Dialog:
  - a `.csv` file input, up to 10 MB, checked before upload;
  - one line naming the required canonical columns, with a link to the
    template;
  - a submit button that is disabled and spins while uploading.
- The dialog POSTs to `/api/v1/imports`. `modules/ui/importCsv.ts` maps the
  answer to what the dialog shows:
  - 202: "Import started — N rows", with a link to Jobs. The import has
    started; nothing is shown as finished.
  - 400: the message and up to five row/column details.
  - Anything else: a failure with the server's message.
  - A 202 without a row count is shown as a failure.
- Pages with a menu:
  - Agents: agents and non-human identities.
  - Identities: all, people, external and machine identities; lifecycle
    work; attributes.
  - Access: applications (one menu with applications, entitlements and
    access grants), accounts, requests, packages, request policies and
    data sources.
  - Governance and operations: policies, risk findings, investigations,
    runtime events, the audit trail, certification campaigns.
  - Integrations: integrations, jobs, identity sources, application
    discovery and MCP servers.
  - Settings: groups, roles and authorization policies.
- Headers that had no action area now wrap with
  `flex flex-wrap items-start justify-between gap-3`, so the menu drops
  below the title on a phone.
- The menu uses only theme tokens (`popover`, `accent`, `border`), so it
  follows light and dark mode. It is keyboard-operable through Radix.

Verification is in the Operations audit entry of the same date. Not checked
in a browser: this session runs no dev server.
## 2026-10-10 — Integrations on two levels: Connection types and Connections (user request)

User request: a menu of connection types that lists every type with its
protocol details, and a menu of connections created from those types.

**Routes, before → after:**

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `/integrations` "Integrations", "+ Connect a system" | `/integrations` "Connections". One primary action, "New connection", goes to the types list. The Type column names the type and version and links its type page. |
| `/integrations/connectors` (catalog of cards) | `/integrations/types` "Connection types": one dense table per category (Type, Protocol, Reads, Receives, Version). Below `md`, rows stack into labelled cards (shared `TableContainer`). |
| (none) | `/integrations/types/{origin}/{key}`: protocol details as a description list, with one primary action, "Create connection". The definition and "Use as a starting point" are folded under "Definition". |
| `/integrations/connectors/{origin}/{key}` (connect form) | `/integrations/types/{origin}/{key}/connect`, with a back link to its type |
| `/integrations/connectors/new` | `/integrations/types/new` "Write a connection type" |

- The old URLs are page-level `permanentRedirect()` files, so
  `next.config.ts` is unchanged; `?from=` is kept.
- The connection page's header now reads "Type: Keycloak v1.0.0", linked to
  its type, and its back link reads "← Connections".
- A receive-only type (Agent runtime, Webhook) shows no authentication,
  pagination or rate limit rows, since WonderID makes no requests to it;
  its Receives row lists each channel's path and how the sender
  authenticates. The connection page keeps its Receiving card and receiver
  secret form unchanged.
- The "add a generic integration" link is gone with the generic form; the
  MCP Servers page and the Runtime empty state point at the new URLs.

**Navigation** (`modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`), Integrations:

- Connections;
- Connection Types;
- Gateway (`/integrations/gateway`, a page built in a parallel change);
- Identity Sources, Pending Matches, MCP Servers and Sync Jobs, unchanged.

Longest-prefix matching keeps Connection Types current on its sub-pages.

**Minimal UI (§19.5):**

- The list page lost its "Connected systems" card header.
- The types list has no buttons: each name is the row's one link.
- The type page has one button.
- Server components throughout, two queries in parallel on the connections
  page, tokens only (light and dark), no new dependency.
- No route-level `loading.tsx` was added. None of the Integrations pages had
  one, and `app/(customer)/loading.tsx` covers them.

**Verified:**

- typecheck and eslint clean; vitest 221/221 (27 files, 1 skipped) in
  `modules/integrations modules/ui tests/architecture app`.
- E2E specs updated, not run here:
  - `integrations.spec.ts`: the new flow through types, the type page and
    its connect form, the redirects, and the authoring page;
  - `mcp-bridge.spec.ts` and `mcp-inventory.spec.ts`: the MCP server's
    connect form at its new URL;
  - `navigation-smoke.spec.ts`: the headings Connections and Connection
    types, and a type page;
  - `design-review.spec.ts`: the types list and a type page at every width
    and in both themes.
- The user-facing help guide was not changed (§19.7).

## 2026-10-10 — EXPERIENCE-P0-26: install the app on phones and tablets (founder request)

Before this change WonderID had no web app manifest and no install support:
only `app/icon.png`, `app/apple-icon.png` (180, opaque) and `app/favicon.ico`.

**Built:**

- **Manifest** — `app/manifest.ts` (Next's file convention, served at
  `/manifest.webmanifest`), built by `modules/ui/install/manifest.ts`:
  name and short name "WonderID", description, `id`/`start_url`/`scope` `/`,
  `display: standalone`, `theme_color` `#ffffff` (`--card`, the header),
  `background_color` `#f3f6fa` (`--background`), icons 192 and 512
  (`any`) and a maskable 512, `related_applications` = this manifest's own
  absolute URL (`platform: webapp`), `prefer_related_applications: false`.
  It reads the request host per request (`ƒ` in the build), because each
  organization address is its own origin; a host that is not a plain
  hostname drops the self-reference. No service worker: Chrome no longer
  needs one, and the app does not work offline or send push, so no copy
  claims either.
- **Icons** — `public/brand/app/icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` (the brand
  mark `public/brand/logo/wonderid-mark.png` on a white tile with rounded
  transparent corners, mark at 66% width) and `icon-maskable-512.png`
  (full-bleed white, mark at 56% width, its corners inside the 80% safe
  circle: half-diagonal 174px against a 205px radius). Resampled with
  Pillow from a scratch script outside the repo; nothing redrawn. Paths and
  colours are in `wonderIdBrand.app` (`modules/ui/brand.ts`). The Apple
  touch icon stays `app/apple-icon.png`, the sheet's own white app icon.
- **Root layout** — `viewport.themeColor` (light `#ffffff`, dark `#13171f`,
  `--card` in each theme); `appleWebApp` (capable, title "WonderID",
  status bar `default`), plus `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` for older iOS
  (Next emits only `mobile-web-app-capable`).
- **Early capture** — `InstallPromptCapture`, an inline `<head>` script
  beside `ThemeFlashGuard` (the CSP already allows inline scripts), catches
  `beforeinstallprompt` before hydration, calls `preventDefault()` and
  parks it on `window`; on `appinstalled` it records "installed".
- **Banner** — `modules/ui/install/InstallAppBanner.tsx`, rendered first in
  `<body>`, so it sits above every header (the customer shell, the landing
  page, Get Help) in the document flow and pushes the page down; the
  sticky header and the `lg` sidebar stick to the top once it scrolls away.
  It decides with the pure `installBannerVariant()`
  (`modules/ui/install/eligibility.ts`):
  - shown only on a phone or tablet (`userAgentData.mobile`, or Android /
    iPhone / iPod / iPad, or iPadOS-as-Mac with `maxTouchPoints > 1`, and
    always a coarse primary pointer; a touch laptop does not count);
  - hidden when running installed (standalone, fullscreen, minimal-ui,
    window-controls-overlay, iOS `navigator.standalone`), when
    `getInstalledRelatedApps()` returns an entry (it waits for the answer
    rather than flashing), in in-app browsers and frames, on
    `/platform-admin`, `/auth/*`, `/api/*` and any print/export/embed path;
  - Chromium: one-tap **Install** only once `beforeinstallprompt` has fired;
    it calls `prompt()` and awaits `userChoice`;
  - iOS/iPadOS Safari, and other full iOS browsers from 16.4: **How to**
    opens two steps (Share with the share glyph inline, then Add to Home
    Screen) and "I've added it";
  - Firefox on Android, webviews, desktop: nothing.
  - Memory (`localStorage` key `wonderid-install-banner`, every access in
    try/catch, no user or tenant data): installed or "I've added it" →
    never again; Close or a declined prompt → 14 days.
  - Design: the 40px app icon, "WonderID", one line ("Approvals and
    findings on your home screen, full screen."), a pill Install / How to
    button and a 44px Close; tokens only, both themes; `print:hidden`;
    `env(safe-area-inset-top)`; eases in from zero height, off under
    `prefers-reduced-motion`. `role="region"` labelled "Install the WonderID
    app", named buttons, `aria-expanded` on How to, no autofocus. Minimal UI:
    one primary action and Close.
- **Get Help** — new "Installing WonderID on a phone or tablet" section
  (Getting started), at the founder's request for this feature.
- **Foundation** — `proxy.ts` matcher now skips `manifest.webmanifest`; see
  the Foundation audit entry of the same date.

**Verified:**

- `npm run typecheck` clean (after `npx next typegen`); eslint clean on the
  changed files (`npm run lint`: 0 errors, one existing warning in
  `app/actions/connectors.ts`); `npx vitest run`: 1026 passed, 125 files
  (1 skipped). New: `eligibility.test.ts` (15: desktop, standalone,
  Chromium with and without the event, iOS Safari / iPadOS / Chrome 16.4+
  and pre-16.4, Firefox Android and webviews, related apps, snooze,
  routes), `manifest.test.ts` (6: fields, icon files and sizes, the
  self-reference), `InstallAppBanner.test.tsx` (8: variants, prompt,
  snooze, appinstalled, blocked storage), two proxy matcher tests.
- `next build` passes; `/manifest.webmanifest` is dynamic.
- Local `next dev` without Supabase variables, Playwright Chromium: the
  manifest serves as `application/manifest+json` under the unchanged CSP,
  and the head carries the manifest link, theme-color and Apple meta.
  Screenshots at 390 (Android with a dispatched `beforeinstallprompt`, and
  iOS Safari, collapsed and How to, light and dark), 320, 768 and 1180
  (iPadOS with the sidebar), over the landing page and a scratch copy of
  the customer shell's header, tab bar and sidebar (deleted before commit;
  the real shell needs a session). 0px horizontal overflow; the header
  starts exactly under the banner and sticks to the top on scroll; no
  banner on desktop 1440, Firefox Android, `/platform-admin`, or Android
  without the event; Close and Install write the expected memory.
- Not verified: a real device install, and the signed-in shell itself.
  No E2E run (the suite needs service-role secrets).

### 2026-10-10 — Import dialog: a preview table, then Confirm import or Cancel import

User request: "a preview screen should be shown with nicely laid out version
of same data in ui, it should have confirm or cancel import button".

**The dialog (`ObjectActionsMenu.tsx`) now has three steps.**
1. Choose the file, then **Preview**.
2. A wide preview with:
   - the file name and row count;
   - one badge per result;
   - a three-way filter: All / New and updates / Not imported.
   It also has a scrolling table with a sticky header, in the page's own
   columns plus Row, Result and Notes:
   - an **Update** row shows each changed cell as old → new, highlighted;
   - **Not imported** and **Needs review** rows give the reason.
   Its buttons:
   - **Confirm import (N)**, disabled as "Nothing to import" when nothing
     would change;
   - **Cancel import**;
   - **Choose another file**.
3. The result, taken only from the import's own counts:
   - one line saying what was added, updated, or already up to date, and
     how many rows were not imported;
   - those rows in a folded list;
   - the page's list is refreshed (`router.refresh()`).

**Behaviour and states.**
- Escape and clicking outside are blocked while a request runs.
- If the import's answer is lost, the dialog says so and asks the person to
  check before retrying. It never guesses success (§17.5).

**Logic.** In `importCsv.ts`: `previewResponseState`, `importResultState`,
`columnLabel`, `outcomeSummary` and `importableRows`. Covered by 12 tests.

**Verified.** Typecheck and eslint clean. The dialog flow, including Cancel
storing nothing, is covered by `file-import.spec.ts` on Vercel; see the QA
log.

### 2026-10-10 — Dashboard: no queries for a user without an organization

**Found in the database logs.** In the 24 hours to 2026-10-10 11:50 UTC
there were 757 requests with `tenant_id=eq.null`, all answered 400. Every
one came from the dashboard's five queries: `agents`, `risk_findings`,
`runtime_events` and its two counts.

**Cause.** For a signed-in user with no organization, the customer layout
redirects to onboarding or no-access. Next renders the page alongside the
layout, though, so `app/(customer)/page.tsx` had already queried with
`ctx.tenantId!` (null).

**Fix.** The page returns nothing when there is no organization, and lets
the layout's redirect stand. No other page appears in the logs.

**Verified.** Typecheck and eslint clean on the changed file. After the
deploy, the logs should show no new `eq.null` requests from the dashboard.

### 2026-10-10 — Two sidebars: the main sidebar for members, an Admin sidebar for administration

**What the owner asked for.**
- Menus for end users come first, starting with Home.
- Admin comes last.
- Everything that administers the organization moves inside Admin.
- Clicking Admin re-renders the sidebar with "Admin" at the top and a back
  button to Home.
- The default (landing) sidebar is a normal member's.

**What changed.**
- **Main sidebar.** In order:
  - Home;
  - My Access: Request Access, My Privacy, Sign-in Security (the member's
    own MFA);
  - Identities;
  - Applications;
  - Access Governance (Access Requests, Access Packages);
  - Certifications;
  - Risk & Security;
  - AI Agents;
  - Insights;
  - **Admin** as the last entry.
- **Admin sidebar** (`ADMIN_NAV`), headed by a back button and "Admin":
  - Organization: Organization, Notifications, AI Assistance, Billing;
  - Users & Permissions: Users, Groups, WonderID Roles, Permission Catalog,
    Authorization Policies;
  - Authentication: Single Sign-On;
  - Integrations: Connections, Connection Types, Gateway, Identity Sources,
    Pending Matches, MCP Servers, Sync Jobs;
  - Identity Configuration: Identity Attributes;
  - Policies & Compliance: Policies, Request Policies, Privacy & Data
    Protection, Audit Integrity.
- **Which sidebar shows** follows the page (`isAdminPath`, longest matching
  section across both). Any link to an admin page therefore opens the Admin
  sidebar; Back goes to Home. Collapsed, Admin is a gear icon and Back an
  arrow.
- **Permission filtering.**
  - Every entry now names the permission its page requires, and the layout
    filters both sidebars with the viewer's permissions (`navFor`).
  - A member sees only what they can open.
  - Admin appears only when at least one admin page is open to them, and
    leads to the first such page.
  - Pages still check permissions themselves; this only decides what is
    listed.
- **Unchanged.** The mobile tab bar. The drawer renders the same body, so
  it gets both sidebars too.

**Verified.**
- `tsc` clean; eslint clean.
- `modules/ui`: 85 of 85 tests pass, including the new `shell-nav.test.ts`
  (7). It checks:
  - Home is first and administration is out of the main sidebar;
  - every route appears once;
  - admin pages are detected by longest prefix;
  - filtering by permission works;
  - there is no Admin entry without an admin permission.
- `tests/e2e/shell.spec.ts`:
  - new: Admin is last, opens the Admin sidebar, and Back returns Home;
  - the "current section opens" test now uses the Admin sidebar.

  These run on Vercel; see the QA log.

**Not changed.** The help guide (`modules/ui/help/content.ts`) still
describes the old menu names; it is updated only when asked (§19.7).

**Same day, sidebar scrollbar (owner request).** The sidebar used the browser's
default scrollbar, a bright light track on the dark rail. It now uses a
`.sidebar-scroll` class in `app/globals.css`:
- a thin bar with a transparent track;
- the thumb is drawn in `--sidebar-muted-foreground` at 35%, so it follows
  both themes;
- the thumb appears only while the sidebar is hovered or has focus.

Checked by rendering the CSS in Chromium with scrollbars on: a resting
sidebar shows no bar, a hovered one a thin muted thumb.

**Browser tests on Vercel (before merging PR #30).** The specs were shell,
design-review, navigation-smoke, branding, permission-catalog and
first-organization (deployment `DGq3WSvPVtVidTk6buK3Hq5jgCyk`): **87 passed,
0 failed, 0 flaky**, in 13 min. The first attempt failed only on the Vercel
Toolbar's script; the cause and fix are in the QA log.
### 2026-10-10 — Sign-in: methods that are not set up show disabled

**Why.** Owner request: "unless these options are working keep them
hidden", then "instead of hidden show them disabled".

**What changed.**
- The sign-in page reads which methods Supabase Auth has turned on, from
  `/auth/v1/settings`, server-side and re-read every 5 minutes.
- Methods that are off show disabled, with "Not available yet". On
  2026-10-10 that was Microsoft, LinkedIn and SSO; Google and email were on.
- A method becomes active by itself once enabled.
- The sign-up page reads the same status in the browser.
- An unreadable status leaves every method on: Supabase stays the
  authority.
- Code: `modules/ui/authProviderStatus.ts`, `SocialAuthButtons`, and the
  SSO button in `app/sign-in/SignInForm.tsx`.

**Verified.**
- Unit tests: 13 pass.
- Sign-in baselines re-recorded and reviewed:
  - Ubuntu: the mobile image locally; the desktop image stayed within
    tolerance.
  - Vercel builder: both images in a recording run, in which the other 11
    branding tests passed.

## 2026-10-10 — Sidebar arranged in areas (after a study of Saviynt's menu)

**Why.** Owner request: study how Saviynt arranges its sidebar from its
public documentation and screenshots, take only the concept ("how it
differentiates and arranges menu", the menu-only search box and the version
in the footer; not the colours, fonts or UI), keep the existing menus, and
implement it.

**What changed.**
- `modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`: `SHELL_NAV` is a list of areas — Home (Home,
  My Access, Access Governance), Identities, Applications, Certifications,
  Risk & Security, AI Agents, Insights, and `ADMIN_AREA` always last (its
  groups: Organization, Users & Permissions, Authentication, Integrations,
  Identity Configuration, Policies & Compliance). `activeArea()` picks the
  area by longest path prefix; `isAdminPath()` uses it; `searchNav()`
  matches menu labels only and returns each hit with its trail. The
  separate `ADMIN_NAV` and `adminLanding` are gone.
- `modules/ui/AppSidebar.tsx`: the area list, shown on the front door ("/")
  and reached from any area with the back arrow ("All areas"); every other
  page opens its area's menu, with folding groups, and marks the page; a search box ("Search menu") whose
  results list is labelled "Matching pages", with "No menu item matches."
  when empty; one `<nav aria-label="Main">`; a footer with the version
  (`vX.Y.Z · commit`, from `package.json` and `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` in
  `app/(customer)/layout.tsx`).
- `modules/ui/shell-nav.test.ts` (12 tests) and `tests/e2e/shell.spec.ts`
  rewritten for areas, search and the footer.
- CLAUDE.md §13's navigation note now describes areas.

**Verified.** Unit tests 12/12; typecheck and eslint clean; local
Playwright (headless Chromium, `E2E_CHROMIUM_PATH`): `shell.spec.ts` 18/18
after one fix (the area list is shown on "/" only; a member's own settings
page opens Home's menu), and `integrations`, `identities` and
`design-review` 52/52 in the same build.

## 2026-10-10 — Every object page shows who created and changed it

**Why.** Owner decision (CLAUDE.md §19.10; Foundation log, migration 0115).

**What changed.**
- `modules/ui/RecordProvenance.tsx`: one muted line under the title,
  "Created by … on … · Updated by … on …" (en-GB, UTC); the date alone when
  nobody is recorded; no "Updated" within a second of creation; nothing when
  the record is unknown. `provenanceText()` is unit-tested (4 tests).
- The line is on 18 object pages, loaded in the page's existing parallel
  wave (no new waterfall): account, application, access package, access
  request, agent, certification campaign, identity, application discovery,
  policy, investigation, authorization policy, group, role, identity
  source, connection, privacy breach, privacy request, and the member page
  (its membership, found by `user_id`).
- `tests/e2e/identities.spec.ts`: the newly created person's page shows
  "Created by … on …".

**Left out.** Lists (§19.5). Pages that are views of an agent (access,
runtime, risk, rogue) show nothing extra; the agent's own page has the line.

## 2026-10-10 — Every area opens its own menu; each page in it has an icon

**Why.** The owner sent a screenshot of Saviynt's Certifications menu: the
area opens into its own list (back chevron, the area's icon and name), and
each page in it is a row with its own icon. In WonderID, Certifications (one
page) went straight to that page, and the pages in an area's menu were plain
text. As before, only the arrangement was taken; the menus, colours and
type are WonderID's.

**What changed.**
- `modules/ui/AppSidebar.tsx`: an area with any pages, even one, opens its
  menu; only an area with no pages is a link. An area's direct pages render
  at area-row size with their icon; a group heading shows the icon it
  already declared (never rendered before); pages inside a group stay
  text, under the heading's label. The collapsed rail's flyouts show the
  same icons.
- `modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`: `link()` takes an icon; every area page has
  one (e.g. Certification Campaigns `ClipboardCheck`, Accounts `IdCard`,
  Data Sources `Database`, Investigations `FileSearch`). `NavIcon` gained
  `IdCard`, `Database` and `FileSearch`.
- `modules/ui/shell-nav.test.ts`: every area page and group has an icon.
- CLAUDE.md §13's navigation note says so.

**Not done.** Saviynt's Certifications menu also lists a dashboard,
campaign templates and scheduled campaigns. WonderID has no such pages
(Compliance Agent scope); they are not added to the menu until they exist.

**Verified.** Typecheck and eslint clean; `shell-nav` unit tests 13/13;
screenshots of the Certifications, Identities, AI Agents and Admin menus
in light and dark mode at 1440 px; local Playwright below.

## 2026-10-10 — EXPERIENCE-P0-27: new areas, Admin's object lists, collapsible rail, Control Center

**Why.** Owner decisions the same day, in order: Identities and
Applications belong under Admin; the area list is Home, Intelligence,
Onboarding, Control Center, SOD and Certifications (asked directly: build
real Control Center and SOD pages, and the arrangement as proposed, with
Risk and Insights folded into Intelligence, agent registration and
discovery into Onboarding, AI Agents kept); Admin gets Accounts,
Entitlements, Roles and User Groups; the sidebar collapses from a
hamburger-style toggle at its top right, as in Saviynt's screenshots
(arrangement only, WonderID's colours and logo kept).

**What changed.**
- `modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`: the new areas and Admin (its four object
  lists as direct pages, then Identities, Applications, Organization,
  Users & Permissions, Authentication, Integrations, Compliance). Policies,
  Request Policies and Authorization Policies moved to Control Center;
  Pending Matches to Onboarding; Rogue Agents, Reports and Audit Trail to
  Intelligence. Every route is still listed once.
- `modules/ui/AppSidebar.tsx`: the toggle is `ListIndentDecrease` at the
  top right when open and `ListIndentIncrease` at the top of the rail when
  collapsed; the rail has a search icon that opens the sidebar with the
  focus in its search box; the W mark moved to the rail's foot as a link
  home (BRAND-004 still holds).
- `app/(customer)/controls/page.tsx`: the Control Center overview. Every
  number is a count of the tenant's own records, each card links to its
  list, and a card is left out (not shown as zero) for a viewer who may not
  open its list. The SoD and entitlement pages are in the Access log.
- `NavIcon` gained `Gauge`.
- The owner's working copy of the menu: the Google Sheet "WonderID sidebar
  menus" (55 rows, generated from `shell-nav.ts`: area, group, item, path,
  icon, permission, page status and a change-request column). CLAUDE.md §13
  says to read it and apply the owner's changes.

**Verified.** Typecheck and eslint clean; unit tests `shell-nav` 14/14 and
`sodRules` 6/6; `next build` passed; screenshots of the area list, the
collapsed rail, Control Center, SOD, Entitlements and Admin at 1440 px with
no page errors. Local Playwright (headless Chromium): shell,
navigation-smoke, branding and design-review 90/91 on the first run; the
one failure was the mobile test still opening the old "Insights" area,
fixed to "Intelligence", after which `shell.spec.ts` passed 19/19.

### 2026-10-10 — Policies move into Admin (owner, from the menu sheet)

The owner reviewed the "WonderID sidebar menus" sheet ("this is okay,
policies can go in admin") and moved Policies, Request Policies and
Authorization Policies to Admin. They are now a Policies group in Admin,
after Applications ("Policies" was typed in the sheet's area-icon column,
read as the group's name); Control Center holds its overview. Verified:
`shell-nav` unit tests 14/14, typecheck and eslint clean, and local
Playwright `shell` + `navigation-smoke` 64/64 on a fresh build.

## 2026-10-10 — Global Configuration page; help guide brought up to date

**Why.** Owner requests: Global Configuration under Admin, and "update the
help guide".

**What changed.**
- `/settings/configuration` (Admin › Global Configuration, after User
  Groups): one form in six sections, each setting with one line of help and
  its default, read-only where the member lacks its permission, one Save;
  a folded change history with who, when and each change from and to, and
  Restore on earlier versions. A member without either permission is sent
  to Administration, like the other admin pages.
- Help guide (`modules/ui/help/content.ts`): every menu path rewritten to
  the new sidebar (42 paths); "Finding your way around" rewritten for areas,
  the collapsible rail, menu search, the version footer and record history;
  new articles Global Configuration, Control Center and Separation of duties
  (SOD); Accounts gains Entitlements and the configured dormant threshold;
  Integrations rewritten for connection types and connections, settings and
  masked credentials; sign-in notes shorter organization session limits.
  `content.test.ts` requires the three new articles.
- `tests/e2e/global-configuration.spec.ts`: an administrator changes the
  dormant threshold, the Accounts page follows it, the history shows it,
  and it is put back; saving with no change says so; a read-only member has
  no menu entry and is sent back from the page.

## 2026-10-11 — Reconciliation console (EXPERIENCE-P0-28, F1, #47)

Most of the console was built with the stories it depends on:
- the connection page shows each sync job, its post-sync steps with
  counts, the held-run Mark missing / Discard decision, and Run sync now
  with a refreshing progress state (INTEGRATION-P0-18/19);
- the application page has Preview access, then Apply (ACCESS-P0-27);
- the account page shows each access with its classification and any open
  finding (ACCESS-P0-25).

This story fills the gaps:
- Connection page: each job also says how many objects it marked gone from
  the source (marked, or approved after a hold).
- Application page: "Access last reconciled <when>" (or failed, with the
  reason), from the last applied access reconciliation.
- Account page: each access row adds "last seen at source <when>" (the
  ledger's last verified time).

Every page keeps its existing permission gate and shows only stored
records; no new control was added (one primary action per card, §19.5). The
new lines use token classes only, so they work in both themes and wrap on
narrow screens.

**Verified.** Typecheck, eslint and `next build` are clean.

### 2026-10-11 — Connection page and source form (INTEGRATION-P0-20)

- The sync schedule moved from the file connection's Files card to the Sync
  jobs card of every connection that reads (`ConnectionScheduleForm`). One
  select and Save; a member without `integration.update` sees the value as
  text. Visible controls per page are unchanged: the form moved, it was not
  added twice.
- The identity source form's target list now includes the organization's
  active custom attributes, after the standard fields.

**Verified.** `connection-schedule.spec.ts` drives the form; the
identity-sources UI test still passes.

### 2026-10-11 — Admin menu regrouped by the foundation design's §8 (owner decision)

**Why.** The owner asked to rearrange the menus to match the new design.
Asked directly, they chose to follow §8 of
`docs/WonderID/reference/WONDERID-FOUNDATION-DESIGN.md` exactly. This
replaces the 10-10 arrangement, in which Accounts, Entitlements, Roles and
User Groups were top-level Admin pages. The area list is unchanged.

**What changed** (`modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`).
- Admin is now seven groups:
  - **Identity Repository:** Overview, All Identities, People, External,
    Machine, Accounts, Entitlements, User Groups, Lifecycle Work, Identity
    Attributes;
  - **Applications;**
  - **Policies;**
  - **Integrations:** Connections, Connection Types, Identity Sources, Sync
    Jobs, Gateway, MCP Servers;
  - **Users & Permissions:** Users, Roles (WonderID's own roles), Permission
    Catalog, Single Sign-On;
  - **Settings:** Organization, Global Configuration, Notifications, AI
    Assistance, Billing;
  - **Compliance.**
- The Authentication group is folded into Users & Permissions.
- Admin's landing page is the identity Overview. A viewer without
  `identity.read` lands on their first permitted page, as before.
- Every route still appears once, with the same permissions.

**Also: rogue access in Risk Overview** (owner request). `/risk` lists open
rogue-access findings alongside agent findings, most severe first. Each one
leads to its account page and is labelled "Application account".
`FindingRow` now carries `href` and `subject` instead of an agent id. The
Intelligence badge adds `countOpenAccessFindings()`, one count query under
RLS.

**Verified.**
- `shell-nav` unit tests 14/14, rewritten for the groups.
- Local Playwright: `shell`, `global-configuration` and `design-review`
  44/44.
- Local Playwright: `f1-reconciliation`, `risk` and `shadow-ai` all pass
  (the F1 suite 14/14 on its re-run). The F1 suite now checks that the rogue
  finding is listed on `/risk` and links to its account. Its unowned account
  name is now unique per run, because an earlier run's account in the
  shared tenant made the name check ambiguous.
- Typecheck and eslint clean.

### 2026-10-11 — EXPERIENCE-P0-29: request tracking, one inbox, subject picker (#55)

**What changed.** No migration and no new page or menu entry: the existing
Access Requests screen does the work.

- **Each line's real state.** My requests (and every view) shows where a line
  stands, from the server's own records (`lineState` in
  `app/(customer)/access/requests/labels.ts`, shared with the request page):
  - before approval, its status: waiting, rejected, cancelled, expired;
  - once approved, its progress from its fulfilment tasks and grants
    (`requestProgressFor`, two reads per page): waiting for fulfilment,
    fulfilled but not yet verified, verified at the source, or
    **failed** (a task reported failed; new in `requestProgress`);
  - time-bound access past its end date reads "Ended".

  Wording follows what was asked: add, remove, disable, extend. Nothing is
  shown as done before the server records it (§17.5).
- **One inbox.** "Waiting for you" now lists the fulfilment tasks waiting for
  you, above the approvals waiting for you, with a count on the tab. A task
  is yours when it is assigned to you or claimed by you. Someone who can
  approve access also sees tasks with no owner. Each task has its one action
  (Claim, then Done or Report a problem), the same as on Fulfilment Tasks.
- **Subject picker.** "For" on the request form groups:
  - you;
  - the people you manage (`listDirectReports`, no search needed);
  - what you own (service accounts, machine identities, agents);
  - people found by search.
- **Placeholder accounts** (ACCESS-P0-28) read "none yet" instead of their
  internal `pending:` reference, on both task lists.
- Task wording moved to `app/(customer)/access/fulfilment/labels.ts`, so
  Fulfilment Tasks and the inbox say the same thing.

**Design review (§32).**
- Screens checked: the inbox at 390 px and 1280 px, light and dark, with a
  task and an approval waiting.
- Design tokens and the existing components only; one action per row.
- Not changed here: the Approve/Reject buttons in the approvals table wrap
  at 1280 px. That is unchanged from before this story.

**Verified.**
- Typecheck, ESLint and `next build` are clean.
- Vitest: 1226/1226. New tests:
  - `lineState`: each state; ended; never more than the server knows;
  - `requestProgress`: failed;
  - task wording and placeholder accounts.
- E2E (local): `f1-reconciliation` 19/19. The new test makes the signed-in
  admin the application's technical owner and the manager of a new person,
  then submits a request for that person and checks:
  - "Waiting for you (n)" lists the task, and Claim gives "Done";
  - My requests shows "Approved · waiting for fulfilment";
  - "For" lists the person under "People you manage".

  `request-catalog` and `approval-engine` passed, 34 in all with the
  above.

### 2026-10-12 — Non-human identities fits at 1024px

`design-review.spec.ts:149` (1024px, part 1) failed: `/agents/identities`
scrolled sideways (a 722px table in 670px). Two causes:
- the external reference under each name is long monospace text, and
  `truncate` cannot shorten it inside a table cell without a width limit;
- "Agent likelihood" showed from `lg`.

Fix:
- the reference is capped at 14rem and truncated, with the full value in
  its title;
- "Agent likelihood" now shows from `xl`, with Source and Owner.

The page has no fewer controls and no more. Verified:
- E2E `design-review` at 1024px and 1280px (parts 1 and 2): passed;
- a screenshot at 1024px.

### 2026-10-13 — New navigation from the owner's sheet; platform-wide dashboard

**Navigation** (owner decision, the sheet "WonderID: proposed navigation", taken
as final; Request Access kept first under Access on the owner's later
instruction). `modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`:
- **Main sidebar:** Home (Dashboard), My Workspace, Access, AI Agents, Access
  Reviews, Risk & Detection, Self Service, then Administration.
- **Admin sidebar:** Identities, Applications, Policies & Controls, Reports &
  Audit, Users & Roles, Integrations, Organization Settings, Privacy & Audit.
- Industry-standard names throughout: Workforce, Non-Human Identities,
  Identity Matching, Orphaned Identities, Connector Library, Authoritative
  Sources, API Clients, Governance Settings and so on.
- **Views as menu items:** My Requests (`?view=mine`), Approvals
  (`?view=waiting`), Provisioning Tasks (`?view=all`), Onboarding Reviews
  (`/access?status=onboarding`) and Create Campaigns (`?launch=1`).
  `matchScore` makes the current item the one whose route and query both
  match, the first on a tie. The sidebar reads the query with
  `useSearchParams`.
- **New pages and views:**
  - `/risk/rogue-accounts`: open rogue-access findings, paged in the
    database (`listOpenAccessFindingsPage`);
  - the catalog's "Being onboarded" filter (`ONBOARDING_IN_PROGRESS`);
  - the launch form first and focused for Create Campaigns.

**Dashboard** (owner request): "Security Overview", with a platform summary
above the AI-agent section (`app/(customer)/PlatformSummary.tsx`):
- the cards are identities by type, lifecycle work, live and onboarding
  applications, orphaned accounts, requests waiting, rogue accounts, and
  open and overdue review items;
- each card is a head count or one aggregate, read under RLS, and shown only
  with the area's read permission;
- an unreadable count says "Unavailable";
- it streams under its own Suspense boundary with a skeleton.

Verified:
- `npm run typecheck`; eslint on the changed files.
- Vitest 738/738 (`modules/ui`, `access-governance`, `risk`,
  `certification-compliance`, `lib`). The new nav tests cover views, ties
  and areas.
- `next build`.
- Local E2E: `shell`, `navigation-smoke`, `welcome`, `compliance`,
  `application-catalog` and `access` 89/89; `auth` 36/36. `shell.spec.ts`
  is rewritten for the new menus and adds a test that My Requests and
  Approvals highlight separately.

Not changed:
- the mobile tab bar (Home, Agents, Discover, Risk);
- the help guide (not updated unless asked).

- **2026-10-13 (owner):** "Access Requests" in the Access menu is now "All Requests", so it no longer reads like "Request Access" above it.

### 2026-10-13 — Appearance switch fits the account menu (owner)

The Light, Dark and System text buttons overflowed the account menu.
`ThemeToggle` is now a compact segmented control:
- sun, moon and monitor icons, each with an accessible name and a tooltip;
- `role="radiogroup"`;
- the current choice raised on a muted track.

The help and welcome pages use the same control. Checked by screenshot of
the menu at 1280px.

## 2026-10-13 — WonderID AI moved to the account menu; switcher shows the name only; language picker story (owner requests)

- **WonderID AI** is now an item in the top-right account (avatar) menu, above Get Help. It opens the assistant's question box on `/help`. The sidebar entry is gone.
- **The organization switcher button** shows the organization's name only. The environment badge and address line are gone; the coloured dot and environment chips stay.
- **New story EXPERIENCE-P0-32** (Medium, owner request): a language picker in the header, beside notifications and help. Open question for the owner: which languages ship first.

**Verified.** Typecheck and eslint clean. Local E2E: help, navigation-smoke and shell 84/84, plus first-organization and tenant-address in the 34/34 run recorded in the Platform audit log.

## 2026-10-14 — EXPERIENCE-P0-30: guided connector definition editor

**What was built.** Write a connection type (`/integrations/types/new`) now opens on a **Form** tab beside the **JSON** tab.
- **One shared text.** Both tabs edit the same text, which is what the page validates (`validateDefinition`, on every change) and what Publish and Try it send. A definition built in the form therefore validates and publishes exactly like one pasted as JSON.
- **What the form edits** (`GuidedForm.tsx`):
  - basics: name, key, version, category and description;
  - settings;
  - authentication: none, bearer, basic, header, query and OAuth client credentials, each starting from a preset that references `{secret.<key>}`, plus the connection test path;
  - one resource at a time: method, path, where the records are, pagination (none, page, offset, cursor, Link header, SCIM) and field paths.
- **What stays in JSON.** Anything else is kept untouched and labelled "edit in JSON": other drivers, other auth types, templates, constants, path lists, transforms, writes and receiving. A kind with several requests is edited by its first request.
- **Field picker.** Once Try it returns, each field input offers the first sample record's paths (`profile.email`, `groups[].name`) with an example value. The preview already shows the mapped records.
- **Minimal UI (§19.5).**
  - A resource shows its required fields and the ones already mapped; the rest sit behind "Map another field".
  - Sections are collapsible.
  - Publish stays the single primary action.
- **Pure helpers.** `modules/ui/connectorEditor.ts`: presets, path reading and setting (transforms kept), first-request editing, and sample paths, bounded to 200.

**Verified.**
- `modules/ui/connectorEditor.test.ts` 5/5, including a check that every auth and pagination preset passes the server's validation.
- `integrations.spec.ts` 15/15 against a local production build. It includes the new spec: form edits reach the JSON and back, and the form's definition publishes. The existing "checks a definition as it is typed" spec now opens the JSON tab first.
- Screenshots at 1280 (light) and 390 (dark) show no horizontal overflow.
- Typecheck, eslint and `next build` are clean.

**Left.** The field picker is unit-tested, but not driven end to end against a live system: a preview needs a reachable API. The form does not edit writes or receiving channels; those stay in JSON.

## 2026-10-14 — One installed app for every organization and environment (owner request)

The owner installed WonderID and could not switch organization or
environment inside it. Cause: each organization and environment is its own
origin (`<slug>.id.wonderapps.biz`), and an installed web app stays on the
origin it came from, so a switch left the app (browser overlay or the
browser) or was dropped. Asked, the owner chose one app for everything.

Built:
- **Manifest** (`modules/ui/install/manifest.ts`, `app/manifest.ts`): on
  the main address the app opens at `/organizations` and declares
  `scope_extensions` for `https://*.<base>`; on an organization address
  the manifest says `display: "browser"`, so it no longer installs a
  separate app that could never switch. Without organization addresses
  (local) nothing changes.
- **Opt-in** at `/.well-known/web-app-origin-association` on every address
  (rewrite in `next.config.ts` to `app/web-app-origin-association`, outside
  `/api` so the connector boundary is unchanged): names only the main
  address's app, never an organization; public like the manifest.
- **`/install`** on the main address (public; on an organization address it
  redirects there): the browser's install prompt when it offers one,
  otherwise where to find it. The account menu links to it.
- `lib/tenant/host.ts` and `proxy.ts`: `/install` is served on the main
  address and needs no session.

Browser support (checked 2026-10-14): `scope_extensions` ships in Chrome
and Edge 138 (desktop and Android) and Samsung Internet; not in Safari or
Firefox, where a switch still opens in the browser. Wildcard origins follow
Chrome's documented example (`https://*.example.com`); this cannot be
exercised in CI and is to be confirmed on the owner's phone after deploy.
Each address keeps its own sign-in (unchanged).

Verified: typecheck; eslint; Vitest install, tenant and architecture
85/85 + manifest 33/33; `next build`; over HTTP on a local build
(`BASE_APP_HOST=localhost`): main manifest has the extension, the
organization manifest is `browser`, the association names only the main
app, `/install` 200 on main and 307 to it from an organization address;
local E2E `auth`, `org-address-required`, `tenant-address`: 42 passed,
1 skipped (skipped on main too).

Left out: an app installed earlier from an organization address must be
removed and installed again from the main address.

## 2026-10-14 — Correction: one installed app switches only on a computer

After #198 the owner found that on Android a switch still opened in
Chrome's overlay. The compatibility table relied on was derived data;
Chrome's own announcement says scope extensions are not supported on
Android (web apps there have a different identity model). Asked, the owner
chose to keep the overlay on phones. The knowledge base now says switching
inside one app works in Chrome and Edge on a computer only; the code
(#198) stays as it is.

## 2026-10-14 — Create lives under Actions on every list page (owner decision)

Owner feedback on the Policies page: "You can add the create option under
actions, no need to add the create row at the end. Add create option under
action for all the pages, put it in Claude.md." Recorded as a rule in
CLAUDE.md §19.5 (Minimal UI).

What changed:
- `modules/ui/ObjectActionsMenu.tsx`: an optional `create` prop
  (`{ label, title, content }`) adds a first menu item (Plus icon,
  separated from export/import) that opens the form in a dialog styled like
  the import dialog. The dialog scrolls inside the viewport, fits a phone
  (`calc(100vw - 2rem)`), has a close button and starts in the form's first
  field. The menu renders when only `create` is given.
  `useCloseCreateDialog()` lets a form that stays on the page close the
  dialog after a save; `CreateDialogForm` does it for a plain server-action
  form. Both are no-ops outside the dialog. Exported from `modules/ui`.
- Pages moved (form, gate, action and validation unchanged; the item is
  passed only when the old card was shown):
  - `/policies` (Create policy…), `/risk/investigations` (Open
    investigation…), `/integrations/discovery` (Add discovery…; "Discover
    from a connector" stays, it runs discovery rather than creating one
    record), `/identities/attributes` (Add attribute…), `/identities/rules`
    (New rule…), `/access/data-sources` (Add data source…; "Link an
    entitlement" stays), `/access/classification-rules` (New rule…),
    `/access/onboarding-templates` (New template…), `/access/delegations`
    (New delegation…), `/compliance/campaigns` (Launch campaign…; the
    `?launch=1` view from the menu still shows the form at the top),
    `/settings/groups` (New group…), `/settings/authorization-policies`
    (New policy…), `/settings/automation` (New credential…),
    `/settings/sso` (Add connection…), `/settings/privacy` (per section:
    Log request…, Record breach…, Add record…, Add purpose…, Place legal
    hold…);
  - vendor console: `/platform-admin/tenants` (Create organization…),
    `/platform-admin/announcements` (Publish notice…),
    `/platform-admin/billing` (Request adjustment…).
- Close after save: forms that redirect close by navigating (policies,
  investigations, discovery, groups, authorization policies, rules,
  templates, campaigns, privacy requests and breaches). Forms that stay call
  the hook: attributes, data sources, delegations, `PrivacyForm` (records,
  purposes, legal holds) and the `CreateDialogForm` ones (SSO, tenants,
  announcements, billing adjustment). The automation credential dialog
  deliberately stays open: the new secret is shown there once.
- "…below" empty-state copy now says "from Actions".

Deliberately left:
- `/my-privacy` "Make a request": a member's own data-rights page, not an
  admin list; the request form stays in view so the right is easy to use.
- `/settings/security` "Add an authenticator app": a personal enrolment
  flow (QR code, verify step), not a list create.
- `/access/request-policies` "Set a policy": an upsert editor whose scope
  is picked by a GET form that reloads the page, which would close a dialog.
- `/platform-admin/admins` "Grant platform admin": the PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS
  bootstrap (WID-H10, today) lands there with the form shown and its own id
  filled in; the bootstrap spec relies on that.
- Detail-page forms (edit, add-to, relationships) and
  `app/(customer)/access/applications/[id]/*` (another session).
- Header "New …" buttons that open a `/new` page (users, packages,
  applications, identities) are already header actions.

Verified: `npm run typecheck`; eslint on changed files (clean); Vitest
`modules/ui` + `tests/architecture` 18 files, 139 tests passed (9 in
`ObjectActionsMenu.test.tsx`, 7 new: create-only menu renders, create item
first and separated, dialog titled and holding the form, focus in the first
field, hook closes, `CreateDialogForm` runs the action then closes, hook is a
no-op outside); `npm run build` passed. Local E2E against a production build
on port 3200: application-discovery, authorization, automation-credentials,
compliance, data-sources, groups, investigations, policy-publish,
platform-admin, role-reviews: 71 passed, 1 skipped (the WID-H10 bootstrap
test, PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS not set locally); navigation-smoke,
trust-compliance, approval-delegation, identity-rules, classification-rules,
onboarding-templates: 87 passed. After the focus change a rebuild and rerun
of eight of those files: 52 passed, 1 skipped, 1 failed
(automation-credentials API-only test 2 hit the 30 s test timeout mid-way,
then passed with the whole file, 14/14, on its own run; the UI change does
not touch it).

Specs changed: each opens Actions → the create item before using the form
(application-discovery, authorization, automation-credentials (form,
status and secret now read inside the dialog), compliance, data-sources,
groups, investigations, policy-publish, platform-admin, role-reviews).
data-sources: a saved create closes the dialog, so the "Added X." message
is no longer on screen; the spec now asserts the dialog closed and the new
source's row is in the list, and the read-only check also asserts there is
no create item in the menu.

## 2026-10-14 — "ID Roles" in the sidebar, and an ID Roles tab on a person's page

Owner feedback: WonderID's own roles are "ID roles", and every person's
page should offer adding one. Foundation's audit log (same date) has the
service side.

- Sidebar (`modules/ui/shell-nav.ts`): Users & Roles → "ID Roles" (route
  unchanged, `/settings/roles`); the Administration landing link likewise.
  `shell-nav.test.ts` updated for the search result label.
- Person identity page (`app/(customer)/identities/[id]/page.tsx`), HUMAN
  identities, for viewers with users.view, roles.view, roles.assign or
  role.manage: a new "ID Roles" tab after Overview (the page's tab
  pattern). It lists the ID roles held (name, system or custom, terms),
  with the shared remove button per role and, folded behind an "Add ID
  role" disclosure (§19.5), the existing assign form with its scope terms.
  Both only with roles.assign/role.manage, and never on your own page
  ("Another administrator manages your own ID roles."). Without a
  membership the tab says they need WonderID access first (the header's
  "Give WonderID access" link is not repeated). A failed read says so
  instead of showing an empty list. The groups tab now says "ID roles:".
- Controls: one new tab; the add form is folded; nothing else added.

Specs changed: `custom-roles`, `users`, `groups`, `authorization`,
`shell`, `navigation-smoke`, `identities` (renamed text, plus the new ID
roles test). Verified: local E2E 19/19 `identities`, 92/92 for the rest;
typecheck, eslint, vitest 153/153, `next build`.

### 2026-10-14 — Mobile bottom bar: only "More" (owner request)

The owner crossed out the four shortcut tabs (Home, Agents, Discover,
Risk) in a phone screenshot: "remove the crossed out part, keep the more
button intact". `MobileTabBar` now holds only More, at the right, which
opens the full navigation drawer as before; `MOBILE_TABS` is removed. The
design-review E2E expects one target in the bar.

Verified: typecheck; eslint; Vitest modules/ui + lib/refs 121/121; local
E2E shell + design-review mobile/rail tests 13/13. Separately, a full
design-review run showed `/agents` 8px too wide at 1280px with the E2E
data (a page this change does not touch); left for its own fix.

### 2026-10-14 — Mobile "More" is a floating button (owner)

Owner: "I meant just a floating more button, not entire navbar." The bar
(full-width strip with a border) is gone; `MobileTabBar` is now a round
56px button at the bottom right, above the home indicator, opening the
same navigation drawer. Its accessible name stays "More", so the shell and
design-review tests are unchanged apart from a message.

Verified: typecheck; eslint; local E2E shell + design-review mobile/rail
tests 13/13; a 390px screenshot shows the round button over the content, bottom right.

### 2026-10-14 — Agents list fits at 1280px

The design-review sweep found `/agents` 8px wider than its card at 1280px with
long owner names (Owner was `whitespace-nowrap`, 265px). Owner names now wrap,
and the table is 926px in 926px. Verified: the design-review spec passes 7/7
locally.


## 2026-10-16 — Help centre behind sign-in; guide brought up to date (owner request)

**Before:** `/help` and `POST /api/v1/help/ask` were public (since
2026-09-18). The landing page's menu and footer, and "Need help?" on the
auth screens, linked to them. There was no sitemap, robots file or service
worker, and no email linked to help.

**Part 1, sign-in required:**
- `proxy.ts`: `/help` left `PUBLIC_PATHS` and `UNENFORCED_PATHS`, so idle
  and absolute session expiry apply there too. A signed-out help request
  goes to `/sign-in?next=<path>`.
- `lib/auth/returnTo.ts`: `safeReturnTo()` accepts only same-site help
  paths, so `next` cannot become an open redirect. `SignInForm` uses it
  after a password sign-in. Social and SSO sign-in still land on `/`.
- `app/help/layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` both check `getSessionUser()`; the
  page check matters because a client navigation can fetch the page without
  its layout. The pages are `force-dynamic`, with robots `noindex,
  nofollow`, so they are never prerendered or publicly cached.
- The help assistant's route answers 401 without a session, with no guide
  text and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Public links:
  - the landing page's menu and footer lost their Help links;
  - `AuthShell`'s "Need help?" became a mailto, "Need help? Email us".
- Stays public: the landing page (with the contact mailto), sign-in,
  sign-up, forgot and update password, `/auth/*`, `security.txt`, install,
  and the error pages. The app has no privacy or terms pages.

**Part 2, content:**
- An inventory taken from `shell-nav.ts`, the routes, the settings registry
  and the reports list found:
  - 30 sections still on the menu from before 13 Oct;
  - factual errors:
    - campaigns "agents only";
    - organization-wide MFA "not built";
    - Reports "eight";
    - the Home overview;
    - the mobile tab bar;
    - the organization switcher's place;
    - the Add user steps and buttons;
    - "Review ownership";
    - an incomplete settings list;
  - pages with no help at all.
- Rewritten in the UI's own words, after checking each label against the
  code.
- New sections: Rogue accounts, Provisioning tasks, Delegations and My
  Team, Identity rules, API clients.
- Every section has an `updated` date, shown as "Last updated".
- What's new now lists the newest features.
- `modules/ui/help/links.test.ts` fails when a section's link, an in-app
  path in its text, a `/help#` anchor or a What's new item points at a page
  or section that does not exist. Routes are read from the `page.tsx`
  files.
- `content.test.ts` checks the dates, rejects the old menu names and
  requires the new sections.

**Verified:**
- unit tests (help, proxy, `returnTo`, `helpAnswer`): 57/57;
- typecheck and eslint clean; `next build` passed, with `/help` dynamic;
- local E2E `help`, `welcome`, `auth` and `tenant-address`: 64/64;
- by hand on the production build: signed out, `/help`, `/help?q=x` and
  `/help/anything` answer 307 to sign-in with no guide text in the body;
  the API answers 401; the landing page has no `/help` link.

## 2026-10-19 — Help guide brought up to date (owner request)

Owner request: update the help guide with the latest features. The guide
was refreshed on 16 Oct (#235); every merge since was checked against it,
and the changes from 14 and 15 Oct that the refresh missed.

Added or corrected in `modules/ui/help/content.ts`, each article's
`updated` set to 2026-10-19, in the UI's own words:
- Finding your way around: record pages open at their short number, old
  links redirect; create forms live in the list's Actions menu.
- Requesting and approving access: request numbers (REQ and nine digits,
  with the barcode).
- Applications and onboarding: the page's tabs; entitlements added by hand
  under a type, edit/disable/delete; "Requestable" vs "Needs a request
  policy"; the account name format; corrected the approval rule, since an
  administrator may approve their own submission with a note, recorded as
  self-approved (owner decision 14 Oct).
- Provisioning tasks: new accounts named by the format; standard access to
  the everyday account, admin access waits for a person.
- Connecting source systems: the guided Form beside the JSON and "Try it
  against a system"; MCP tools that are AI agents, "Declared by the server".
- Agent discovery: MCP agent tools appear there.
- Authoritative identity sources: the Default ID role invitation.
- Users and membership: the ID Roles tab on a person's page.
- FAQ "Why can't I see…": "We couldn't check your access".
- Rogue accounts: "could not be checked just now".

Already covered, checked: approval workflows, SoD over access, business and
IT roles, merges, policy versions, configuration export/import, campaign
calendar and analytics, owner reviews, identity rules, agent delegation,
audit field changes, the control reports, the mobile More button.

**Verified:** `modules/ui/help` tests 17 passed (links resolve); eslint and
typecheck clean. No E2E asserts the changed sentences.

## 2026-10-19 — Release notes in Get Help (owner request)

Owner request: a "Release Notes" section in the help, with a new entry each
time the owner confirms a new version is live, covering every feature
released since the previous entry.

- `modules/ui/help/releaseNotes.ts`: `RELEASE_NOTES`, newest first; each
  entry has an id (`release-YYYY-MM-DD`), the date, the live production
  commit, a one-line summary and highlights linked to guide sections.
- `/help`: the Release notes card replaces the hand-kept "What's new" list
  (one place for what is new, §19.5): the latest release in full, earlier
  ones under "Earlier releases"; a Contents link. `WHATS_NEW` removed.
  Also fixed "Last updated" printed twice on every guide article.
- First entry, 19 Oct 2026 at c90afe4: the features live from 14 to 19 Oct
  (15 highlights), matching the knowledge base's revision history.
- The rule is in CLAUDE.md §19.7: on the owner's confirmation that a
  version is live, add an entry from `git log <previous commit>..<live>`,
  and bring the help guide up to date in the same pull request.
- `links.test.ts`: every highlight links to an existing section; entries
  are newest first, ids unique and well formed, commit present.

**Verified:** `modules/ui/help` and `lib/ai/helpAnswer.test.ts`, 33 passed;
typecheck and eslint clean; `next build` passed.

## 2026-10-20 — The header shows the person's name, not their email (owner feedback, item 13)

A person whose account has no display name (`users.display_name` empty, for
example one invited from an identity) was shown by email in the header and
account menu. The layout now falls back to their identity's name in the
current organization (`getIdentityForUser`, read in the layout's existing
parallel wave, so no extra round trip in sequence), then to the email.

**Verified:** typecheck, eslint on `app/(customer)/layout.tsx`; E2E in the
nightly run.
