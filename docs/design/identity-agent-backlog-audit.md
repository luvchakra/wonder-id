## 2026-09-13 — IDENTITY-P0-01 through P0-03 (initial implementation)

**Agent:** Identity Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly` (same
deviation Foundation Agent recorded: this environment pins all work to the
harness-assigned branch rather than a separate `module/identity` worktree).

**Built — full P0 backlog in one pass:**

- **IDENTITY-P0-01.1** — `agents` table (migration `0012`) with RLS: client-facing
  tenant-scoped SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE (no DELETE — retirement is a lifecycle
  transition, never a row deletion). `createAgent()`/`getAgent()`/`listAgents()`
  in `modules/agent-identity/agents.ts`, exposed at `POST/GET /api/v1/agents` and
  `GET /api/v1/agents/:id`, plus bare functional pages `/agents` and
  `/agents/new` matching the worked example's exact fields.
- **IDENTITY-P0-01.2** — `agent_identities` (migration `0013`), manual linking
  only per the backlog's explicit P0 scope (no fuzzy-matching engine).
  `linkAgentIdentity()`/`listAgentIdentities()`, `POST/GET
  /api/v1/agents/:id/identities`.
- **IDENTITY-P0-01.3** — discovery inbox: `listAgents(tenantId, { status:
  "discovered_unregistered" })` always returns `[]` right now — **Integration
  Agent has not been dispatched**, so there is no normalized import contract to
  read through yet. This is the documented, allowed "don't block, don't invent
  the other module's architecture" path from `CLAUDE.md` §7, not an oversight.
  Revisit once Integration Agent publishes its contract.
- **IDENTITY-P0-02.1 (higher bar)** — `agent_lifecycle_events` (migration
  `0015`) and the full transition state machine in
  `modules/agent-identity/lifecycle.ts`, reproducing the backlog's table
  exactly: `DISCOVERED→REGISTERED` (requires active business_owner +
  technical_owner, non-empty purpose, source_system set),
  `REGISTERED→APPROVED` (requires an active `agent_contracts` row, and the
  actor must be an agent owner or hold `IAM_ADMIN`/`TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN`),
  `APPROVED→PROVISIONED` and `PROVISIONED→ACTIVE` (manual, no extra
  precondition), `ACTIVE→CERTIFICATION_DUE` (system-actor only, computed lazily
  on read via `maybeMarkCertificationDue()` inside `getAgent()`/`listAgents()`
  rather than a cron, exactly as the backlog allows),
  `ACTIVE→RESTRICTED`, `CERTIFICATION_DUE→ACTIVE`, `RESTRICTED→SUSPENDED`
  (requires `SECURITY_ADMIN`/`IAM_ADMIN`/`TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN`),
  `SUSPENDED→RETIRED`, and the "any state → SUSPENDED" emergency wildcard
  (requires `SECURITY_ADMIN`/`TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN`). Every transition writes
  both the `agent_lifecycle_events` row and a `writeAudit()` call, exactly as
  specified. Exposed at `POST/GET /api/v1/agents/:id/lifecycle`.

  **Judgment call, flagged rather than left silent:** the backlog's transition
  table doesn't say whether "any state → SUSPENDED" includes `RETIRED` as a
  valid `from`. I read `RETIRED` as terminal (nothing transitions out of it,
  full stop) since the backlog's whole chain treats it as the end state and no
  other row in the table ever transitions *from* `RETIRED`. Implemented that
  way in `isStructurallyAllowedTransition()`; flagging in case the intent was
  different.

  **Backlog inconsistency noted, not silently resolved:** the state list
  (`DISCOVERED → REGISTERED → ASSESSED → APPROVED → ...`) includes `ASSESSED`,
  and the `agents.lifecycle_state` CHECK constraint includes it too, but the
  backlog's own "Allowed transitions" table has no row transitioning into or
  out of `ASSESSED` anywhere — `REGISTERED` goes straight to `APPROVED`. I
  implemented exactly what the transition table says (no path through
  `ASSESSED` in P0), leaving the state reachable only for schema
  forward-compatibility. Not treating this as an ambiguity worth stopping for
  since the transition table is unambiguous on its own; noting it so a future
  session doesn't wonder why `ASSESSED` is unreachable.

- **IDENTITY-P0-02.2** — `agent_owners` (migration `0014`), client-facing RLS
  (tenant-scoped, same pattern as `agents`). `assignOwner()`/`removeOwner()`
  (soft-remove via `removed_at`)/`listOwners()`/`getOwnershipIssues()` in
  `modules/agent-identity/owners.ts` — the last one returns
  `missing_owner`/`inactive_owner`/`ownership_conflict`/
  `missing_recommended_owner` facts only, never a `risk_findings` row (Risk
  Agent's job once it exists). Exposed at `POST/GET /api/v1/agents/:id/owners`
  and `GET /api/v1/agents/:id/ownership-issues`.
- **IDENTITY-P0-02.3** — `agent_relationships` (migration `0017`), client-facing
  RLS. `addRelationship()`/`listRelationships()`/`removeRelationship()`,
  exposed at `POST/GET/DELETE /api/v1/agents/:id/relationships`. No automatic
  discovery from runtime traces, per the backlog's explicit P0 boundary.
- **IDENTITY-P0-03.1 (higher bar)** — `agent_contracts` (migration `0016`),
  versioned exactly as specified: `createContractVersion()` supersedes the
  prior active row and inserts `version + 1` as the new active one, backed by
  a partial unique index (`agent_contracts_one_active_per_agent`) enforcing
  "at most one active contract per agent" at the database level, not only in
  application code. `getAgentContract()` (active only) and
  `listContractVersions()` (full history). Exposed at `POST/GET
  /api/v1/agents/:id/contracts`.

**Security design decision (not explicit in the backlog, but a direct
extension of Foundation's own reviewed precedent for `audit_logs`), recorded
here rather than left implicit:** `agent_lifecycle_events` and
`agent_contracts` grant **no** client-facing INSERT/UPDATE policy at all —
only `transitionAgentLifecycle()` and `createContractVersion()` (via
`supabaseServiceRole()`, after their own validation) may write them. Every
other Identity table (`agents`, `agent_identities`, `agent_owners`,
`agent_relationships`) uses ordinary tenant-scoped client RLS plus an
app-layer `requirePermission()` check, matching how the backlog explicitly
described `agents` itself. Rationale: the transition table's validity and the
contract's versioning invariant are business rules no RLS tenant-check can
enforce — a client-facing INSERT policy on either table would let any tenant
member forge lifecycle/SHOULD history via a direct REST call, bypassing this
module's own logic entirely. Verified directly: see
`tests/identity/tenant-isolation.sql` — a same-tenant, correctly-scoped
`INSERT` into both tables is rejected by RLS specifically *because* no client
policy exists, not merely because of a tenant mismatch.

**Verification run:**
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` — all clean.
- `npm run test` — 12/12 passing, including
  `modules/agent-identity/lifecycle.test.ts` (pure unit tests for
  `isStructurallyAllowedTransition()` covering every row of the transition
  table, the any-state-to-SUSPENDED wildcard, and RETIRED's terminality).
- Tenant isolation proof executed directly against the live dev Supabase
  project via the Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool (same methodology Foundation
  used, for the same reason: this sandbox's network egress cannot reach
  Supabase directly). Fixture: two tenants, one full agent graph each
  (agent + owner + identity + active contract + lifecycle event). Result,
  acting as Tenant A's user: every table returned only Tenant A's own row;
  Tenant B's agent was invisible even by primary-key lookup and a direct
  `UPDATE` against it affected 0 rows; a cross-tenant `agent_owners` insert
  was rejected; and — the specific case this design decision is meant to
  prevent — a **same-tenant** insert into `agent_lifecycle_events` and
  `agent_contracts` was also rejected, since neither table grants a client
  INSERT policy at all. Fixture data deleted afterward; script committed at
  `tests/identity/tenant-isolation.sql`. `get_advisors` (security and
  performance) clean after migration `0018` (tenant_id indexes on the five new
  tables) — no findings beyond the ones Foundation already reviewed and
  accepted (`current_tenant_ids`/`create_tenant_with_owner` REST-RPC exposure,
  `platform_admins`' intentional no-policy state, and the pre-existing
  Supabase-managed `rls_auto_enable`).

**Not started this session (deferred, not blocking other agents):** none of
IDENTITY-P0-01 through P0-03 was skipped — the full P0 backlog for this module
is implemented. The only gap is IDENTITY-P0-01.3's discovery inbox returning
empty pending Integration Agent, documented above.

**Dependencies consumed:** Foundation's `getTenantContext()`,
`requirePermission()`, `writeAudit()`, `supabaseServer()`/`supabaseServiceRole()`,
`lib/shared/types/foundation.ts` — all used exactly as published, no
modification to any Foundation file.

**Published this session, for Access/Runtime/Risk/Compliance/Experience to
consume once dispatched:** `modules/agent-identity/service.ts` (barrel) and
`lib/shared/types/agent-identity.ts` — see both files' contents for the full
exported surface (`getAgent`, `listAgents`, `getAgentContract`,
`transitionAgentLifecycle`, `getOwnershipIssues`, etc.). No other module has
been dispatched yet, so nothing has consumed this contract in anger; the
critical acceptance test (register FinanceBot, assign ownership, define the
SAP/Snowflake contract, walk it through
`DISCOVERED→REGISTERED→APPROVED→PROVISIONED→ACTIVE` with a complete audited
transition history) is buildable end-to-end today via the API routes above,
but has not been run as a scripted scenario in this session — worth doing
either now or as part of a future QA Agent pass.

## 2026-09-14 — IDENTITY-P0-04 (duplicate detection) and IDENTITY-P0-05 (discovery reconciliation)

**Agent:** Identity Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly`.
Auto-chained after Foundation Agent's own P0 completion, per the user's
"operate like before, focus on P0 only, continue automatically" instruction.
Picked up the two new P0 stories the 2026-09-14 requirements refresh added.

### IDENTITY-P0-04 — Duplicate Detection & Merge/Review Workflow

New table `agent_duplicate_candidates` (migration `0041`), RLS-treated as
evidentiary/computed data — client SELECT only, all writes via
`supabaseServiceRole()` in the new `modules/agent-identity/duplicates.ts`
(same pattern as `risk_findings`/`certification_decisions`). Deterministic,
no-LLM scoring (`computeDuplicateScore()`, unit-tested — 5 cases): a
`source_system` + `source_object_id` match scores 1.0 (decisive — the same
external system reporting the same object twice); a case-insensitive
`agent_name` match alone scores 0.6 (weaker evidence, since two distinct
agents can share a display name); anything else scores 0.
`DUPLICATE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.6`.

`createAgent()` (`modules/agent-identity/agents.ts`) now runs this check
before ever inserting an `agents` row; the original insert logic was
extracted into `createAgentRow()` so both the normal path and a reviewer's
"confirm distinct" decision share one implementation. On a match, the
pending registration is diverted into a duplicate-candidate record instead
of being inserted — `createAgent()`'s return type changed from `Agent` to a
`CreateAgentResult` discriminated union (`{kind: 'created', agent}` |
`{kind: 'duplicate_candidate', candidate}`); updated both call sites
(`POST /api/v1/agents` — now returns 202 for the duplicate-candidate case,
201 unchanged for the created case; `createAgentAction` — redirects to the
new `/agents/duplicates` review page instead of `/agents/:id`). A reviewer
can merge (mark `merged` — the pending registration is discarded, and since
it was never inserted as a real `agents` row, the existing survivor's own
lifecycle/audit history is untouched by construction rather than by an
explicit two-row merge) or confirm-as-distinct (`confirmDistinctAndRegister()`
completes the deferred registration now). Both actions audited via
`writeAudit()`. New bare page `/agents/duplicates` plus
`/api/v1/agents/duplicates` (GET) and `/api/v1/agents/duplicates/:id`
(PATCH `{decision: 'merge'|'confirm_distinct'}`).

**Verified live** (Supabase MCP, FinanceBot fixture tenants
`aaaaaaaa-5000-.../bbbbbbbb-5000-...`): Tenant A5's user sees only its own
duplicate-candidate row, Tenant B5's user sees zero; a direct client INSERT
is rejected, a direct client UPDATE affects 0 rows (same select-only +
service-role-write proof pattern used throughout this session).

### IDENTITY-P0-05 — Discovery Reconciliation & Orphaned Identity Detection

New `modules/agent-identity/discovery.ts` — `buildDiscoveryInbox(tenantId)`
reads Integration Agent's now-published contract
(`listIntegrations`/`getNormalizedObjects` from
`modules/integrations/service.ts`) for `identity`-typed normalized objects,
and reconciles each one against `agents`/`agent_identities`:
- Already correlated (an `agent_identities` row exists for that external
  reference, source-keyed as `<integrationId>::<externalId>`) → not shown at
  all (fully resolved).
- Not yet correlated, but scores ≥ the same `computeDuplicateScore()`
  threshold against an existing agent → `likely_duplicate`, with the
  matched agent's id.
- Not yet correlated and no score match → `new`.
- An existing `agent_identities` link whose owning agent is retired or
  missing → `orphaned_identity` (a separate pass over `agent_identities`,
  independent of whether any integration is currently configured).

This directly resolves IDENTITY-P0-01.3's long-standing "always returns
empty pending Integration Agent's contract" limitation — that dependency was
real when 01.3 was first built (Integration Agent hadn't been dispatched
yet); it has since published exactly the contract 01.3's own Dependencies
section anticipated ("once Integration publishes normalized identity/account
import data, Identity may correlate an `agent_identities` row to it"), so
implementing 05 on top of it also completes 01.3 rather than leaving a
second, parallel "discovery" concept. `listAgents()`'s original
`filter.status === 'discovered_unregistered'` branch is left returning `[]`
verbatim for any existing caller of that exact shape (no caller exists
today — grepped to confirm), rather than being repointed at a
differently-shaped `DiscoveryInboxEntry[]` under the same filter contract.
New bare page `/agents/discovery` plus `/api/v1/agents/discovery-inbox`
(GET). Correctly returns `[]` when a tenant has zero configured
integrations, per the same "never fabricate data" rule 01.3 already
followed.

**Not verified against a real integration's live data** (no configured,
credentialed integration exists in this session's fixtures) — the
type-checked composition against Integration Agent's published, already-
tested `listIntegrations`/`getNormalizedObjects` functions, plus this
story's own reconciliation logic being a straightforward function of that
already-typed data, was judged sufficient without fabricating a live
integration fixture solely to exercise this one path; flagged rather than
silently assumed.

**Full verification run**: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run
build` (new routes present: `/agents/duplicates`, `/agents/discovery`,
`/api/v1/agents/duplicates`, `/api/v1/agents/duplicates/[id]`,
`/api/v1/agents/discovery-inbox`), `npx vitest run` — 90/90 passing (5 new:
`computeDuplicateScore`'s decisive/weak/zero-score/mismatched-source/
missing-source-id cases). `get_advisors(security)` re-checked after
migration `0041` — identical accepted-exception set, `agent_duplicate_candidates`
correctly not flagged (it has a select policy, unlike the intentional
zero-policy tables).

**Dependencies consumed:** Foundation's usual set, plus — for the first time
in this module — Integration Agent's published `listIntegrations()`/
`getNormalizedObjects()` contract (read-only, exactly as published, no
reaching into `integration_objects`/`integrations` directly).

---

## 2026-09-14 — Requirements Refresh (round 2, expanded doc) — no new scope found

**Agent:** Identity Agent (documentation/planning pass only — no application
code, migrations or tests touched).

**Task:** the user re-supplied the module 02 requirements document at a new
upload path, described as a newer/expanded version superseding the doc used
for the original 2026-09-14 refresh, and asked for a fresh, thorough
re-check for additional detail, new stories, or refined acceptance criteria
not already reflected in the backlog.

**Performed:** read the full re-supplied document end to end; read the full
current `docs/plan/02-IDENTITY-AGENT-BACKLOG.md` including its Progress
Tracker and existing "Requirements Refresh — 2026-09-14" section; re-read
this audit log's tail; and spot-checked the codebase
(`modules/agent-identity/*`, `supabase/migrations/0012`–`0018` and `0041`)
to sanity-check implementation status rather than trusting the backlog text
alone.

**Finding: no genuinely new requirements, stories, or acceptance criteria.**
The re-supplied document's content (Identity data model summary;
IDENTITY-P0-01 through P0-10; IDENTITY-P1-01 through P1-04; IDENTITY-P2-01
through P2-03; critical acceptance criteria) matches — requirement ID for
requirement ID, and substantively in wording — what the original
2026-09-14 pass already reconciled against. Every requirement ID in the new
upload traces to either:
- an already-`Done` story in this backlog (verified still accurate against
  the current `agents`/`agent_owners`/`agent_identities`/
  `agent_lifecycle_events`/`agent_contracts`/`agent_relationships` schema
  and the corresponding service code), or
- this backlog's own IDENTITY-P0-04 / IDENTITY-P0-05 rows added in the
  first refresh pass (both now `Done`; re-confirmed implemented — duplicate
  detection in `modules/agent-identity/duplicates.ts` +
  `duplicates.test.ts` + migration `0041_identity_duplicate_candidates.sql`,
  discovery reconciliation in `modules/agent-identity/discovery.ts`), or
- an item already carried in the backlog's `## P1` or `## P2` sections.

No Progress Tracker row was added. No existing row's status was changed —
nothing already `Done`/`Partial` was reopened or lowered. A short
"Requirements Refresh — 2026-09-14 (round 2, expanded doc)" section was
added to `docs/plan/02-IDENTITY-AGENT-BACKLOG.md` (immediately before `##
DO NOT IMPLEMENT`) documenting this finding and the requirement-by-
requirement mapping, so a future reconciliation pass doesn't re-derive the
same conclusion from scratch. This entry states the negative result
explicitly, per the task's instruction not to fabricate gaps in order to
appear thorough.

**Open question for the user:** since two consecutive uploads of "the
module 02 requirements doc" (the original 2026-09-14 refresh's source and
this round's re-supplied file) turned out to be content-identical as far as
this module's scope is concerned, it may be worth confirming with the user
whether the re-upload was expected to carry different content, in case the
intended "expanded" document was not the one actually attached at this
path.

---

## 2026-09-15 — Fully Functional Agent Discovery (extension of IDENTITY-P0-05)

**Agent:** Identity Agent.

**Task:** the user supplied a new, large (55-section) requirements
document, "WonderAgent — Fully Functional Agent Discovery," explicitly
framed by its own §0 "Codebase Alignment" section as an *extension* of the
existing `buildDiscoveryInbox()` reconciliation inbox, not a greenfield
rebuild — with an explicit list of forbidden new P0 tables
(`discovery_sources`, `discovery_jobs`, `discovery_records`,
`discovery_evidence`, `agent_discovery_history`, `agent_correlations`) and a
55-item "Codebase-Fit Acceptance Gate." Asked to "implement."

**Built:**
- `modules/agent-identity/detection.ts` (+`detection.test.ts`, 6 cases) — a
  deterministic, rule-based, fully explainable AI-agent detection/confidence
  scorer (never an LLM/ML call — non-negotiable #9 and the spec's own "no
  new fuzzy/ML correlation engine in P0" gate item). Scores named signals
  (AI-runtime/MCP source category, AI-platform identifier fields, AI
  platform metadata fields, naming pattern, service-identity type, metadata
  tags/description, tool/relationship association) against the object's
  `normalized`/`raw` payload already published through Integration Agent's
  contract, and returns `DetectionClassification`
  (`CONFIRMED_AGENT`/`PROBABLE_AGENT`/`POSSIBLE_AGENT`/`NON_AGENT`/`UNKNOWN`)
  + a 0-100 confidence score/level + the full evidence list.
- `lib/shared/types/agent-identity.ts` — added `DetectionClassification`,
  `ConfidenceLevel`, `EvidenceStrength`, `DetectionSignal`,
  `DiscoveryChangeType` (`NEW`/`STALE` — see the honest scope note below),
  `DiscoveryCandidateStatus`, `DiscoveryDecisionType`; extended
  `DiscoveryInboxEntry` with all of the above plus `integrationName`,
  `identityType`, `owner`, `application`, `duplicateMatchScore`,
  `duplicateMatchedKeys`, `candidateStatus`, `linkedAgentId`, `lastSeenAt`.
  The three original categories (`new`/`likely_duplicate`/
  `orphaned_identity`) are unchanged.
- `supabase/migrations/0051_identity_discovery_candidate_decisions.sql` —
  extends the *existing* `agent_duplicate_candidates` table (built for
  IDENTITY-P0-04) rather than adding a new table: `matched_agent_id` is now
  nullable (an "ignore" decision has none), plus new `source_system` /
  `source_object_id` / `decision_type` columns and a widened `status` check
  (`+ 'ignored', 'linked'`). This is the mechanism the spec's own gate item
  "existing duplicate-candidate workflow is reused for P0 review" calls
  for. Applied directly to the live Supabase project via the Supabase MCP
  tool (`apply_migration`) and confirmed with `get_advisors(security)` —
  identical accepted-exception set as before, no new findings.
- `modules/agent-identity/duplicates.ts` — added `recordDiscoveryDecision()`
  (ignore/link, service-role write with the same manual-tenant-check
  pattern as the rest of this file; "link" also calls the existing
  `linkAgentIdentity()` — the real correlation, not a second concept) and
  `listDiscoveryDecisions()` (batch lookup keyed by
  `sourceSystem::sourceObjectId` for `buildDiscoveryInbox()`).
- `modules/agent-identity/discovery.ts` — `buildDiscoveryInbox()` rewritten
  to enrich every entry with the detection/confidence/evidence above, plus:
  - **Change/removal safety (spec §27/§28)**: a `changeType` of `STALE`
    when the source object's `importedAt` predates the integration's most
    recent *completed* sync job (`listSyncJobs()`), i.e. it wasn't returned
    by the latest discovery run — derived entirely from Integration
    Agent's own `integration_sync_jobs` history, no new table. A failed
    sync never marks anything removed (nothing here infers removal from a
    `failed` job — only from a `succeeded`/`partial` one that legitimately
    didn't return the object).
  - **Candidate status**: `open`/`ignored`/`linked`, from
    `listDiscoveryDecisions()`.
  - Still consumes Integration Agent's contract only
    (`listIntegrations`/`listIntegrationTypes`/`getNormalizedObjects`/
    `listSyncJobs`) — never queries `integration_objects` directly.
  - Added `getDiscoveryCandidate(tenantId, integrationId, externalId)` —
    calls `buildDiscoveryInbox()` itself rather than a second query path,
    so the detail page can never disagree with the inbox list.
- `app/actions/agents.ts` — `registerDiscoveryCandidateAction()`,
  `ignoreDiscoveryCandidateAction()`, `linkDiscoveryCandidateAction()`.
  Registration reuses the *existing* pipeline end to end: `createAgent()`
  (whose own IDENTITY-P0-04 duplicate check still applies — a discovery
  registration that collides with an already-registered agent is diverted
  to `/agents/duplicates` exactly like a manual one), `linkAgentIdentity()`
  for source evidence, `assignOwner()` for business/technical owners, then
  the *existing* `DISCOVERED -> REGISTERED` transition
  (`transitionAgentLifecycle`) whose prerequisites (purpose, source_system,
  active business_owner + technical_owner —
  `lifecycle.ts`'s `validateTransition()`) were already exactly what the
  spec asks for; no second registration state machine was written. If an
  owner wasn't supplied, the transition's `PRECONDITION_FAILED` is caught
  and swallowed — the agent stays `DISCOVERED` and the existing
  `getOwnershipIssues()` surfacing on the agent detail page makes the
  missing owner visible (AC-007), rather than failing registration outright
  or inventing a second "missing owner" UI.
- `app/api/v1/agents/discovery/decision/route.ts` — POST endpoint wrapping
  `recordDiscoveryDecision()` for the one client component that needs a
  `fetch()` round trip (the Ignore confirm dialog); every other write goes
  through a server action, matching this codebase's established split.
- UI: `app/(customer)/agents/discovery/page.tsx` rebuilt into an
  operational inbox (spec §17-19) — metric cards (New/High Confidence/Needs
  Review/Potential Duplicates/Recently Changed/Discovery Errors, all
  query-string-linkable), query-string-driven tabs
  (All/New/Needs Review/Potential Duplicates/Recently Changed/Ignored), a
  Sources panel listing configured integrations with a real "Discover Now"
  button per source (`triggerSyncAction` — the *existing* Integration sync
  job endpoint, `POST /api/v1/integrations/:id/sync` → `after()` → real
  connector work; not a second discovery job system), and the candidate
  list via `DiscoveryCandidatesTable.tsx` (built on the shared
  `SimpleDataTable` primitive — search/sort/pagination/responsive
  card-transform for free, same pattern `AgentsTable`/`IntegrationsTable`
  already establish). Candidate Review at
  `app/(customer)/agents/discovery/[integrationId]/[externalId]/page.tsx`
  (spec §21-22, §41-42): Identity, Detection Evidence (every signal with
  source/observed value/strength/score), Source Evidence (raw payload,
  collapsible), Correlation (for `likely_duplicate` entries — reuses
  `computeDuplicateScore`'s existing output, no new scoring), a "Link to
  existing agent" form, a Register form (name/type/purpose/environment/
  identity type/business+technical owner, with the spec's exact "does not
  grant or revoke IAM access" notice), and `IgnoreCandidateButton.tsx`
  (the established `ConfirmActionDialog` + fetch pattern from
  `MergeDuplicateButton`).

**Deliberately scoped down / deferred (flagged, not silently dropped):**
- **Field-level change detection** (`UPDATED`/`OWNER_CHANGED`/
  `IDENTITY_CHANGED` from spec §26) needs a prior-snapshot/fingerprint
  history per source object, which neither Identity nor Integration
  persists today (`integration_objects` is upserted in place with no
  history retained). Adding that would mean either a new Identity-owned
  history table (the spec's own forbidden-table list rules out the closest
  fit, `agent_discovery_history`, for this exact purpose) or an Integration
  Agent schema/behavior change (crosses module ownership — rule #18: record
  and stop, don't silently modify another module's table). Neither was
  done; `DiscoveryChangeType` is honestly scoped to `NEW`/`STALE` only,
  where `STALE` *is* genuinely derivable today (see above). Flagging this
  as the one open cross-module question from the spec's §55 gate item "Any
  required cross-module contract change is documented and explicitly
  approved" — a real fix needs either Identity Agent's own new table (user
  approval to add one despite the spec's list) or Integration Agent
  publishing a change-history contract.
- **Bulk operations** (spec §39, P0: bulk ignore / bulk owner assignment):
  not built this pass — every action here is single-candidate. Flagged as
  a follow-up within this same extension, not a new story.
- **Event-driven discovery, cloud AI platform discovery, owner
  suggestions, agent-to-agent relationship discovery** — all explicitly P1
  in the spec's own §3 scope split; correctly not built.
- **MCP/runtime cross-source signal fusion** (spec §9's "runtime signals":
  tool invocation counts, resource access) is not scanned as a distinct
  detection input beyond "is this integration's category `mcp`/
  `ai_runtime`" — richer fusion (e.g. reading `activity` objects for a
  given identity) is a natural next increment, not started.
- **Registration Dialog's owner/business fields use a raw user-id text
  input**, matching the exact idiom already established by
  `assignOwnerAction`'s own form on the agent detail page (no user-picker
  component exists anywhere in this codebase yet) — not a new gap
  introduced here.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint .` clean (fixed one
`react/no-unescaped-entities` and one now-real `no-unused-vars` — the
latter fixed by adding an explicit `tenant_id` filter to
`listDiscoveryDecisions()`, belt-and-suspenders alongside RLS, matching
`listIntegrations()`'s own documented pattern, rather than suppressing the
warning); `npx vitest run` — 147/147 passing (6 new:
`classifyAgentSignal`'s NON_AGENT/UNKNOWN/weak-service-account/
strong-confirmed/medium-probable/score-cap cases); `npm run build` succeeds
and lists every new route (`/agents/discovery/[integrationId]/[externalId]`,
`/api/v1/agents/discovery/decision`) alongside the unchanged existing ones.
Migration applied to the live dev Supabase project; `get_advisors(security)`
re-checked — no new findings, same accepted-exception set as before.

**Codebase-Fit Acceptance Gate (spec §55) — self-check:** no
`discovery_jobs`/`discovery_sources` table introduced; no direct
`integration_objects` query from Identity; integration data consumed only
through `modules/integrations/service.ts`; discovery runs use the existing
`integration_sync_jobs`/`triggerSyncAction`/`runSyncJob` path; `/agents/
discovery` remains functional and its `buildDiscoveryInbox()` categories
are preserved, not replaced; `agents`/`agent_identities` remain canonical;
the existing duplicate-candidate workflow (`agent_duplicate_candidates`) is
reused, not duplicated; no ML/fuzzy correlation engine added; registration
uses the existing `createAgent`/`linkAgentIdentity`/`assignOwner`/
`transitionAgentLifecycle` services; ownership prerequisites are the
pre-existing ones in `lifecycle.ts`; audit uses `writeAudit()` throughout;
tenant/RBAC checks reuse `requirePermission()` (`agent.read`/`agent.create`)
and RLS; integration credentials were never touched by any new code path;
no other module's implementation was modified (Integration Agent's files
are unchanged) — the one documented cross-module gap is the change-history
question above, recorded rather than silently worked around.

---

## 2026-09-15 — Governance Requirements Reconciliation (documentation/planning pass only)

**Agent:** Identity Agent (documentation/planning pass only — no
application code, migrations or tests touched).

**Task:** the user supplied a new "Updated P0/P1 Governance Requirements"
document spanning all 11 modules and, via `AskUserQuestion`, chose to
reconcile it into the backlogs before any implementation rather than build
against it directly. Full cross-module mapping is in
`docs/design/governance-requirements-reconciliation-2026-09-15.md`.

**Finding:** one genuine, unambiguous, Identity-owned gap, found by direct
inspection of `lifecycle.ts` rather than backlog text: `SUSPENDED` only
transitions to `RETIRED` — there is no restoration path, so the new doc's
"support controlled restoration" (P0-20) requirement cannot be met today.
Added as new Progress Tracker row **IDENTITY-P0-06** (Not Started) with a
full objective/acceptance note in the backlog's own new "Requirements
Refresh — 2026-09-15" section. One minor additive schema gap
(`AgentOwnerType` has no `escalation_owner`) noted but not given its own
row. Two cross-cutting items (contract-schema autonomy/tools/approval
fields; Governance Attestation's P0-vs-P1 tier and possible Compliance
ownership) depend on open decisions recorded centrally and were
deliberately not built or re-tiered unilaterally.

---

## 2026-09-15 — IDENTITY-P0-06: Suspension Restoration Path (built)

**Agent:** Identity Agent.

**Task:** the user said "start on p0 items" after the governance
reconciliation pass above. `IDENTITY-P0-06` was the one concrete,
unambiguous, no-decision-required item from that pass, so it was built
first while the larger cross-cutting items stay open pending the user's
architecture calls.

**Built:** `modules/agent-identity/lifecycle.ts`'s `NORMAL_TRANSITIONS`
gained `RESTRICTED: ["SUSPENDED", "ACTIVE"]` and
`SUSPENDED: ["RESTRICTED", "RETIRED"]` — a staged restoration path
(`SUSPENDED → RESTRICTED → ACTIVE`) rather than a direct
`SUSPENDED → ACTIVE` shortcut, mirroring the path an agent takes *into*
suspension (`ACTIVE → RESTRICTED → SUSPENDED`). This was a judgment call
(the backlog's own refresh entry flagged "pending the user's preference on
whether restoration must pass back through a restricted state first") —
made explicitly rather than left blocking, since it's a reversible,
easily-changed implementation detail, not an architecture decision in
CLAUDE.md's sense. `validateTransition()` gates both new legs behind the
same `RESTRICTED_TO_SUSPENDED_ROLES` (`SECURITY_ADMIN`/`IAM_ADMIN`/
`TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN`) already used for `RESTRICTED → SUSPENDED`, on the
reasoning that reversing a suspension/restriction is at least as sensitive
as imposing one. No new code path: both transitions run through the
existing `transitionAgentLifecycle()` (mandatory reason, `writeAudit()`,
`agent_lifecycle_events` row) exactly like every other transition. No UI
change needed — `app/(customer)/agents/[id]/page.tsx`'s lifecycle-
transition form already lists every `AgentLifecycleState` as a selectable
destination.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint .` clean; `npx vitest
run` — 148/148 passing (2 new cases in `lifecycle.test.ts`: the new
transitions are structurally allowed, and `SUSPENDED → ACTIVE` directly is
still correctly rejected); `npm run build` succeeds. No migration needed —
`agents.lifecycle_state`'s CHECK constraint already permits every state
this touches.

---

## 2026-09-15 — IDENTITY-P0-07: Contract Autonomy & Oversight Fields (built)

**Agent:** Identity Agent.

**Task:** continuing "start on p0 items" now that the user resolved the
autonomy-model ownership question (Identity + Access) via `AskUserQuestion`.

**Built:** migration `0052_identity_contract_autonomy_oversight.sql` adds
`autonomy_level` (int, 0-4, CHECK-constrained), `allowed_tools` (text[]),
`actions_requiring_approval` (text[]), `required_monitoring` (text,
nullable), `required_compliance_controls` (text[]) to `agent_contracts`.
Every new column defaults to the most conservative value (autonomy 0, empty
tool/approval/control lists) so every pre-existing contract row stays
conservative until a human explicitly widens it via a new version —
consistent with this module's existing "never silently unrestricted"
posture. `lib/shared/types/agent-identity.ts` gained `AutonomyLevel` (a
literal `0|1|2|3|4` union, not a bare `number`) and the five new
`AgentContract` fields; `AgentOwnerType` gained `escalation_owner`
(governance doc's P0-05, previously a noted-but-unscoped gap).
`contracts.ts`'s `createContractVersion()` validates `autonomyLevel` is in
range (400 `INVALID_INPUT` otherwise) and persists all five fields with the
same conservative defaults as the migration. `mappers.ts`'s
`toAgentContract()` updated. UI: the agent detail page's contract display
and "Publish new contract version" form both gained the five new
fields/inputs (autonomy-level select with the five governance-doc labels,
three comma-separated list inputs, one free-text field), and `OWNER_TYPES`
gained `escalation_owner` in the owner-assignment form — same idiom as
every other field on that page, no new UI pattern introduced.

**Deliberately not built here:** enforcement of the 4-state action model
(allowed/allowed-with-approval/restricted/prohibited) against these new
fields is Access Agent's `ACCESS-P0-06`, not this story — Identity only
publishes the SHOULD-side data.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint .` clean; `npx vitest
run` — 148/148 passing (unchanged — no new pure-function surface to unit
test; `createContractVersion()` is a DB-touching function without an
existing mock-Supabase test pattern in this module, matching every other
service-role write function here); `npm run build` succeeds. Migration
applied to the live dev Supabase project via the Supabase MCP tool;
`get_advisors(security)` re-checked — no new findings, same accepted-
exception set as before.

---

## 2026-09-16 — published `updateAgentRiskScore()` (unblocks RISK-P0-02.1)

Small, paired addition — the story is tracked under Risk Agent's own
backlog as `RISK-P0-02.1`; full account in that module's audit log.
`modules/agent-identity/agents.ts` gained `updateAgentRiskScore(tenantId,
agentId, riskScore)`: service-role client (this is a system-triggered side
effect of risk evaluation, not a user editing the agent through
`agent.update`), with the tenant_id filter visible in the call per
CLAUDE.md §14. No separate audit event for a routine score refresh — same
discipline `createOrUpdateFinding()` already uses (only a genuinely new
state change is audited, not every re-evaluation refresh). Exported from
`modules/agent-identity/service.ts`. No schema change — `agents.risk_score`
already existed (migration `0012`).

**Verification:** full pipeline (typecheck/lint/`npx vitest run` 217/217/
build/secret-leak check) run as part of Risk's own pass — see that
module's audit log entry for the complete record. No dedicated unit test
added for this thin sink directly (matching the existing pattern for
service-role write functions like `transitionAgentLifecycle`, which also
has no direct mocked-Supabase test) — behavior is covered end-to-end by
`modules/risk/rules.test.ts`'s assertions on the exact values passed to it.

---

## 2026-09-16 — pagination pass (QA-P0-04.3 follow-up, user-prioritized "what's left before launch")

Capped 3 previously-unbounded `list*()` queries with the new shared
`DEFAULT_LIST_LIMIT` (`lib/shared/pagination.ts`, 200): `agents.ts`'s
`listAgents()`, `duplicates.ts`'s `listDuplicateCandidates()`,
`lifecycle.ts`'s `listLifecycleEvents()`. `duplicates.ts`'s
`listDiscoveryDecisions()` was deliberately left uncapped — it builds a
completeness-dependent lookup map `buildDiscoveryInbox()` depends on;
truncating it would make an already-decided discovery candidate reappear
as new (a correctness bug, not a performance one) — see its own inline
comment. `contracts.ts`/`identities.ts`/`owners.ts`/`relationships.ts`'s
per-agent child-record lookups were judged genuinely bounded by real-world
cardinality (an agent cannot realistically have hundreds of owners/
identities/relationships/contract versions) and intentionally left
untouched, avoiding an unnecessary change with correctness risk for
near-zero real benefit.

Verification covered as part of the full cross-module pass — see
`INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` §5's update note for the shared pipeline run.

---

## 2026-09-16 — Egress caveat in this log is obsolete; isolation re-proven with a real client

This log's tenant-isolation entry records that the proof was run through the
Supabase MCP with a server-side simulated JWT "because this sandbox's network
egress cannot reach Supabase directly." That restriction has lifted for HTTPS.
The deferred half has now been done once, centrally, rather than re-run
per module: `tests/live-client-tenant-isolation.mjs` drives two genuinely
authenticated Supabase JS client sessions over HTTPS across **all 44
tenant-scoped tables** — this module's included — in both directions, plus
cross-tenant read/update/delete/insert attempts and an unauthenticated anon
sweep. Every check passed, and the live result agrees with this module's
earlier simulated proof.

No code in this module changed. See
`docs/design/foundation-agent-backlog-audit.md` and
`docs/design/qa-agent-backlog-audit.md` (both dated 2026-09-16) for the full
account, including what remains blocked (raw Postgres; a complete Playwright
E2E run, which needs credentials this environment does not have).

## 2026-09-19 — Two tenant-wide read functions published for Operations' global search

Picked up as a cross-module dependency for OPERATIONS-P0-03.1 (Global
search): Operations' `search()` names "identity" and "owner" as two of the
nine object types it needs to cover, but every existing read on
`agent_owners`/`agent_identities` in this module was agent-scoped only
(`listOwners(tenantId, agentId)`, `listAgentIdentities(tenantId, agentId)`
— the agent detail page's own need). Rather than leave the dependency
recorded-and-blocked, published the tenant-wide counterparts this
module's own data can support:

- **`listOwnersForTenant(tenantId)`** (`modules/agent-identity/owners.ts`)
  — same RLS-protected `agent_owners` table, no `agent_id` filter. Embeds
  `users(display_name, email)` and `agents(agent_name)` via their real FKs
  (migration 0014) so a search result has a human-readable title/subtitle
  without Operations reaching into `users`/`agents` itself
  (non-negotiable #6) — the returned `OwnerWithContext` type is `AgentOwner`
  plus exactly those three extra fields, nothing else changed about the
  existing shape.
- **`listIdentitiesForTenant(tenantId)`** (`modules/agent-identity/identities.ts`)
  — same shape, embeds `agents(agent_name)` via `agent_identities.agent_id`.

Both exported from `modules/agent-identity/service.ts` alongside the
existing agent-scoped functions, which are unchanged and still the right
choice for their own callers.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint clean (fixed two `@typescript-eslint/
no-explicit-any` lint errors from the initial draft — narrowed the raw-row
parameter type instead of using `any`, since these two files aren't
`mappers.ts` and don't carry that file's blanket disable). No unit test of
their own added (this module's existing pattern for thin Supabase-query
wrappers like `listOwners`/`listAgentIdentities` is RLS/live verification,
not client-mocked unit tests) — real coverage is
`modules/operations/search.test.ts`'s new tests, which exercise both
functions' actual consumer. `npm run build` clean. No schema/migration
change — same tables, same RLS, a different filter.

## 2026-09-19 (later) — OPERATIONS-P0-02.2: certification_due and ownership_missing wired

Picked up, at the user's explicit direction, two of Operations' three
previously-unwired notification triggers — the backlog had left them
unwired because each needed a real product decision it didn't specify
("genuinely ambiguous trigger points"); the user asked for reasonable
defaults, clearly documented, rather than leaving them unbuilt.

**`certification_due`** — wired directly into `maybeMarkCertificationDue()`
(`modules/agent-identity/lifecycle.ts`), which already existed
(IDENTITY-P0-02.1) to compute the on-read `ACTIVE -> CERTIFICATION_DUE`
lifecycle transition. This needed **no new scheduler at all**: the
transition table only allows `ACTIVE -> CERTIFICATION_DUE`, so the
function's own existing guard (`lifecycleState !== "ACTIVE"`) already
makes the transition — and now the `notify()` call right after it —
fire at most once per due cycle, whichever request happens to read the
agent first after `next_review_at` elapses. That is a real, single write
event (an `agent_lifecycle_events` insert + `agents.lifecycle_state`
update), resolving the backlog's own "no single unambiguous write event"
concern for this trigger specifically. Targeted at the agent's business
owner (`listOwners()`, matching `escalateOverdueItems()`'s own
escalation-target reasoning); broadcasts (`userId: null`) when there
isn't one.

**`ownership_missing`** — wired into `removeOwner()`
(`modules/agent-identity/owners.ts`). Ownership issues are otherwise
purely derived (`getOwnershipIssues()` computes them on read with no
write of its own), so this hooks the one genuine write event that can
*create* a gap: a removal is snapshotted against the owner list
beforehand, and `notify()` fires only when this specific removal is what
takes a required owner type (`business_owner`/`technical_owner`) to
zero — not merely "a gap happens to exist" (which could be pre-existing
and unrelated to this call). No owner remains to target, so it
broadcasts to the tenant.

**A real gap left deliberately, not silently:** an agent that has never
had a required owner assigned since creation (rather than one removed
later) produces no notification under this design — there is no
discrete write event marking "ownership was never set," and firing on
every single agent creation (which routinely happens without an owner,
as a separate onboarding step) would be close to unconditional noise,
not a meaningful signal. Recorded here rather than guessed at with an
invented grace-period threshold.

**Verified:** typecheck, lint clean. New `modules/agent-identity/
lifecycle.test.ts` coverage (5 cases: notifies the business owner,
broadcasts with none, and three "does nothing" guards — not ACTIVE, not
yet due, no `next_review_at` set) and new `modules/agent-identity/
owners.test.ts` (4 cases: notifies on a gap-creating removal, does not
notify when another owner of the same type remains, does not notify for
a non-required type, still performs the removal/audit either way). Full
vitest suite 342/342 (was 325 before this and the matching Access Agent
change — see `docs/design/access-agent-backlog-audit.md` and
`docs/design/operations-agent-backlog-audit.md` for the third trigger
and the shared dedup helper). `npm run build` (fresh `.next`) clean.

Circular import note: `lifecycle.ts`/`owners.ts` now import `notify`
from `@/modules/operations/service`, which itself imports
`listAgents`/`listOwnersForTenant`/`listIdentitiesForTenant` back from
this module's own `service.ts` (via `search.ts`) — a cycle. This exact
shape already existed before this change (Compliance's
`escalation.ts` -> Operations -> Compliance, via the same `search.ts`
composition) and resolves cleanly because nothing here reads another
module's export at top-level module-initialization time, only inside
async function bodies called later — confirmed empirically (typecheck,
build, and the full test suite all pass) rather than assumed safe.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Fix: `listAgents()` returned every tenant the user belongs to

Found during the light-console rebuild (codebase-map D10).

- **Bug.** `listAgents()` filtered by RLS alone. RLS admits every tenant in
  `current_tenant_ids()`, which is *all* of the user's active memberships.
  A member of two organizations therefore saw both organizations' agents
  in the list, and in every dashboard count built on it, whichever
  organization was selected. It is not a leak to a stranger, but it breaks
  §14 (application-level tenant filtering as defense in depth) and shows
  wrong data.
- **Fix.** An explicit `.eq("tenant_id", tenantId)`.
- **Verified.** Typecheck, lint, the unit suite (352/352) and the full
  Playwright suite (140/141; the one failure is the unrelated sign-up
  provider check, see the Experience entry).
- **Handed to QA Agent.** Sweep the other service reads that take a
  `tenantId` but rely on RLS alone.
- **Also recorded, not fixed** (codebase-map §5):
  - D3: `linkAgentIdentity()` writes no audit event.
  - D4: lifecycle state ASSESSED is unreachable.

---

## 2026-09-25 — New published contract: `getAgentRuntimeProfile()`

This was added for the Runtime Gateway decision (ACCESS-P0-11 and
RUNTIME-P0-15), under the user's ownership decision of 2026-09-25. It is a
contract addition only; no existing export changed.

- **Why.** A gateway call carries an agent API key, not a user session, so
  `getAgent()` and `getAgentContract()` would see nothing under RLS.
- **What it returns.** The agent's lifecycle, environment, criticality and
  risk score; its active contract; and its non-removed identity ids.
- **How it reads.** Through the service role. Every query filters by
  `tenant_id` and every row is re-checked (§14). The tenant and agent must
  come from a verified agent API key.
- **Verified** through `runtimeDecisionLoader.test.ts` (tenant filters and
  unknown-agent handling) and the full suite, 405/405.

## 2026-09-25 — New published contract: `getAgentDisplayName()`

This is additive, in `modules/agent-identity/runtimeProfile.ts`, and
exported from `service.ts`.

- **Why.** The Runtime Gateway's notifications (OPERATIONS-P0-08) are
  raised with no user session, so the RLS-scoped `getAgent()` cannot be
  used.
- **How.** It reads `agent_name` with the service role, filters by
  `tenant_id`, and re-checks the returned row's tenant (§14). It returns
  null for an agent outside the tenant.
- **Compatibility.** No existing contract changed.

## 2026-09-25 — IDENTITY-P0-11 (NHI inventory) and IDENTITY-P0-12 (Shadow AI)

### IDENTITY-P0-11 — non-human identity inventory (master P0-08)

`buildNhiInventory()` (`modules/agent-identity/nhi.ts`, exported from
`service.ts`) and the page `/agents/identities`, listed under Discover in
the nav. It is a read over what Identity already owns, not a parallel
registry:

- **Linked NHIs.** `agent_identities` rows (not removed), with their
  agent. A link whose agent is retired or gone is **orphaned**.
- **Unlinked NHIs.** Integration's normalized identity objects that
  discovery has not correlated (`buildDiscoveryInbox()`), with
  discovery's deterministic classification.
  - The page never implies an NHI is an agent. Each unlinked row shows
    its classification ("Not an agent", "Probable agent", …), and a
    "Likely AI agents" view filters to confirmed or probable ones.
  - An ignore decision shows as **ignored**.
- **Human delegates are excluded.** They are people's accounts, not
  non-human identities.
- **Linking** goes through the existing candidate page: each unlinked row
  links to `/agents/discovery/<source>/<id>`. The inventory itself has
  no write path.
- **Paging.** The page pages at 50 rows, URL-driven. The builder reads up
  to 2,000 links plus the inbox, which is the same cost the discovery
  page already pays.

### IDENTITY-P0-12 — Shadow AI from runtime telemetry (master P0-09)

- **Resolution.** `resolveAgentReference()` is a new published contract,
  service-role and tenant-checked.
  - A runtime event may name its agent by WonderAgent id or by
    `agentRef`, meaning a linked identity's external reference.
  - It resolves by authoritative identifier only (§17.6): exact agent id,
    or exact external reference. It returns
    `unique | none | ambiguous` and never picks the closest match.
- **Unresolved events.** Runtime quarantines an event whose agent
  resolves to *none* as `UNREGISTERED_AGENT`, and one whose agent is
  *ambiguous* as `AMBIGUOUS_AGENT`. The event is never recorded as DID
  and never dropped. See the Runtime audit log for migration 0067 and
  the gates.
- **Inbox entries.** `buildDiscoveryInbox()` adds one `shadow_ai` entry
  per unregistered reference, from Runtime's published
  `listUnregisteredAgentActivity()` (90 days). This happens even when
  the tenant has no integration.
  - The entry carries source, evidence (event count, sources, tools,
    applications, first and last seen), a deterministic classification
    (`shadowAi.ts`, pure), and its register, link or ignore status.
  - Owner is never guessed.
- **Registering.** This reuses the existing candidate flow. The reference
  becomes the new agent's linked identity (source `runtime`), so its
  next event resolves and is recorded. A reference linked by any route
  resolves the inbox entry.
- **UI.** The discovery page has a "Shadow AI" tab and metric, and the
  candidate page explains that the evidence is quarantined, not
  recorded.

**Deliberately left out:**

- A risk score on the Shadow AI entry. That is Risk's to compute
  (RISK-P0-12 names shadow AI as a risk signal).
- The MCP bridge (INTEGRATION-P0-07). Once MCP events reach the event
  route with an `agentRef`, they feed Shadow AI with no further change
  here.

**Performance fix (§15), found while testing this story.**
`buildDiscoveryInbox()` ran two sequential queries per integration
(`getNormalizedObjects` + `listSyncJobs`). E2E Tenant One has 25
integrations, so the discovery page took ~9 s, and under two test workers
the new Shadow AI spec timed out at 30 s. The inbox now makes one parallel
wave over Integration's new tenant-wide reads
(`getNormalizedObjectsForTenant`, `listLatestCompletedSyncStarts`): a
fixed number of queries whatever the integration count. The discovery
page went from **~9.0 s to ~1.45 s**, and `/agents/identities` from
~8.8 s to ~1.47 s (warm, same build).

**Observed, not changed.** A signed-in user with no organization, such as
the platform admin, who opens a customer page is redirected to
/onboarding by the layout. The page's own server component still runs in
parallel and logs a `QUERY_FAILED` (a tenant id of `null`) before the
redirect wins. Nothing is shown or leaked, but the log noise predates
this work. An early `if (!ctx.tenantId) redirect(...)` in each page would
silence it; that is Experience's call.

**Verified (IDENTITY-P0-11/12, with INTEGRATION-P0-07 in the same run):**

- Unit tests:
  - `shadowAi.test.ts` (3)
  - `nhi.test.ts` (4)
  - `runtimeProfile.test.ts` (4: resolution by id and by reference; the
    other tenant's never; ambiguous; removed; every query
    tenant-filtered)
  - Runtime `unregistered.test.ts` (8)
- E2E `shadow-ai.spec.ts`, 4/4:
  - refusal and quarantine;
  - shape validation;
  - the Shadow AI tab for its own tenant only;
  - registration, after which the next event is recorded and the entry
    is gone;
  - the NHI inventory shows it linked, for its own tenant only.
- `/agents/identities` was added to the design-review sweep (every named
  width, both themes, and the column-priority fit check).
- Full pipeline: eslint clean, vitest **476/476**, Playwright **175/175**
  (7.9 min).
- Migrations 0067 (Runtime) and 0068 (Integration index) applied live.

## 2026-09-25 — IDENTITY-P0-14: defects D3 and D4 from the codebase map

### D3 — identity links were unaudited and always "confirmed"

- **Before.** `linkAgentIdentity()` hard-coded `confidence: "confirmed"`
  and wrote no audit event (#11).
- **Now.** Every caller states the confidence and the basis for it, and
  each link writes `agent.identity_linked`. The event records the actor,
  agent, type, source, reference, confidence and basis. The basis lives in
  the audit trail, so no schema change was needed.
- **The callers:**
  - Registering a discovery candidate, or recording a "linked" discovery
    decision, is `confirmed`: a person reviewed the candidate's evidence.
    This includes Shadow AI registration.
  - The manual form on the agent page has a new "Confidence" select
    (default Unverified). The person linking says how sure they are.
  - `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/identities` accepts `confidence` and `basis`.
    **The default is now `unverified`**, where it used to be an implicit
    `confirmed`: a reference asserted through the API with no
    verification is not confirmed.
  - This matters to Compliance's governance posture, which counts only
    `confirmed` or `probable` links as verified. An API caller that has
    verified a link should say so.
- An unknown confidence is rejected (400) before anything is written.

### D4 — ASSESSED was unreachable

- The transition table now has REGISTERED → ASSESSED → APPROVED, the
  master lifecycle's assessment step. The direct REGISTERED → APPROVED
  path is **kept**, so no existing flow changes.
- Entering ASSESSED needs what approval needs: an active contract (the
  SHOULD being assessed), and an approver role or one of the agent's
  owners. Both checks moved into one helper, `assertContractAndApprover()`,
  shared by REGISTERED/ASSESSED → APPROVED; the approval error text is
  unchanged.
- ASSESSED cannot be entered from DISCOVERED, cannot jump to ACTIVE, and
  cannot go back. Emergency suspension from it still works.

**Tests:**

- `identities.test.ts` (new, 2): the stated confidence is stored and
  audited with its basis; an unknown confidence is refused before any
  write.
- `lifecycle.test.ts` +2: the new transitions, and the ones that stay
  forbidden.
- Identity unit tests 41/41.
- Full pipeline: eslint clean, vitest **513/513**, Playwright **187/187**
  (8.7 min, a fresh build).

## 2026-09-25 — IDENTITY-P0-13: contract and ownership completeness (master P0-03/04/06)

**Ownership:**

- **Two new owner types** (migration 0073):
  - `delegated_owner`. A delegated owner acts for someone else for a
    bounded time. The person assigning it is recorded as `delegated_by`,
    and an expiry is required: in the future, at most a year out. The
    service checks both, and so does a database check.
  - `escalation_owner`. The UI already offered it, but the database check
    rejected it, so choosing it failed. That was a live defect.
- **An owner must be an active member of this organization.** Before this,
  any user id was accepted, including another tenant's user.
- **Expired delegations** are a new ownership issue,
  `delegation_expired`. The agent page describes it in words.
- **Ownership review.** New `reviewOwnership()`, with a "Confirm
  ownership" button on the agent page and
  `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/owners/review`.
  - It is refused (412), saying why, while a required owner (business or
    technical) is missing or a delegation has expired.
  - Otherwise it stamps `last_reviewed_at` and `last_reviewed_by` on every
    active owner, and audits `agent.ownership_reviewed`.
  - If RLS lets nothing be updated, it reports 403 rather than a success.
- **The owners list** now shows names instead of ids, "Delegated until …"
  or "Delegation expired …", and "Confirmed …" or "Not yet confirmed".

**Contract:**

- New fields: approved users, approved delegators, allowed environments
  (production, staging, development; none means any), and an expiry. The
  form and the contract display have all four.
- Publishing a contract now sets `agents.next_review_at`. It is the
  certification frequency after publication (monthly 1, quarterly 3,
  semiannual 6, annual 12 months), and never later than the contract's
  expiry. Before this, `next_review_at` was never written.

**Lifecycle:**

- Approving, assessing and going live (PROVISIONED → ACTIVE) all need an
  active contract that has not expired and allows the agent's
  environment. Each refusal is a 412 that says which.
- **Production agents:** approval needs an approver role (IAM_ADMIN or
  TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN). An agent's own owner can still approve a staging
  or development agent, as before. Every agent already reaches ACTIVE
  only through APPROVED, so a production agent is now always approved by
  an approver before it goes live.

### Incident: 0073 broke the owner listing for about 5 minutes (production and local)

- **Cause.** 0073 as first applied gave `agent_owners.delegated_by` and
  `last_reviewed_by` foreign keys to `users`. `agent_owners` then had
  three relationships to `users`, so PostgREST could not resolve the
  unqualified `users(display_name, email)` embed in
  `listOwnersForTenant()`. That call backs the Agents list, Agent 360
  owner names, and search, and it failed in production and locally.
- **Fix.**
  - Migration 0074 drops those two foreign keys. The columns stay; the
    actor is also in the audit event.
  - The embed now names its key, `users!agent_owners_user_id_fkey(...)`,
    so a future foreign key cannot break it again.
  - Verified: `/agents` and search return 200 locally. Production runs the
    old unqualified embed, which is unambiguous again after 0074.
- **Effect on testing.** Four `agents.spec` tests failed in the
  ACCESS-P0-12 full suite that ran through that window. All four passed on
  rerun.
- **Lesson,** applied in 0075 below: never add a second foreign key to a
  table that is embedded unqualified. Replace the key under the same
  name, or name the key in every embed.

### Cross-tenant references to agents closed (migration 0075)

- **Found while writing the isolation test.** `agent_owners`,
  `agent_identities` and `agent_relationships` (both `agent_id` and
  `related_agent_id`) referenced `agents(id)` alone. Their RLS insert
  checks look only at the row's own `tenant_id`.
- **The hole.** A tenant-B member could write a tenant-B row that points
  at tenant A's agent (non-negotiable #4). The unique key on
  `agent_owners` would also have let them probe whether an agent id
  exists.
- **Live data.** No such rows existed; checked before applying.
- **The fix.**
  - `agents` gains `unique (id, tenant_id)`.
  - Each foreign key is replaced by a composite `(agent_id, tenant_id)`
    key under the **same constraint name**, still ON DELETE CASCADE. So
    there is still one relationship per column pair, and every embed is
    unchanged.
- **Verified live** with `tests/identity/same-tenant-agent-refs.sql`,
  running as an authenticated tenant-B member:
  - owner, identity and relationship rows pointing at tenant A's agent are
    all refused (23503);
  - the same writes on B's own agents succeed (1 and 1);
  - no row references A's agent (0);
  - fixtures cleaned up.
- **After 0075,** the agents, navigation and search specs pass (40/40).
- **Still open:** Access's own tables with client insert policies
  (`accounts`, `access_requests`, `policy_exceptions`) have the same
  single-column `agent_id` key. They are recorded for the QA-P0-17 RLS
  sweep, not changed here (#18).

**Tests:**

- `contracts.test.ts` (new, 2): `nextReviewAt` for every frequency, capped
  by the contract's expiry.
- `lifecycleContract.test.ts` (new, 5):
  - an owner cannot approve a production agent but can approve a staging
    one;
  - an expired contract blocks approval;
  - a contract that does not allow the agent's environment blocks going
    live;
  - no contract blocks going live;
  - nothing is written on any refusal.
- `owners.test.ts` +2:
  - a delegated owner with no, past, over-a-year or unparseable expiry is
    refused before any write;
  - the review is refused while a required owner is missing, and nothing
    is audited.
- Identity unit tests 50/50.
- E2E `ownership-contract.spec.ts` (new), on a production agent:
  - a delegated owner without expiry is 400 through the API; a
    non-member owner is 400;
  - through the UI, a delegated owner shows "Delegated until …";
  - "Confirm ownership" is refused, naming the missing owners, then
    confirmed for 3 owners once they are assigned, with "Confirmed
    <today>";
  - a contract with approved users and delegators, staging only and an
    expiry is shown, and approving the production agent is then a 412
    naming the environment;
  - another organization can neither assign owners to the agent nor review
    it.
- `agents.spec` now looks for owners by their readable labels.
- Full pipeline: `tsc` and `eslint` clean, vitest **536/536**, Playwright
  **194/194** (9.3 min, on a fresh build with 0075 applied live).

## 2026-09-25 — Tenant filters and same-tenant keys (with QA-P0-17)

QA-P0-17's sweep changed this module's code and schema. It added
explicit `tenant_id` filters to reads that relied on RLS alone, required
`tenantId` on by-id reads that lacked it, and checked parents on by-id
writes. Migration 0076 (or 0075 for Identity) gave this module's
agent/parent references `(col, tenant_id)` foreign keys under their
existing names. For a member of two organizations, RLS alone admitted
both. The full list, tests and live SQL verification are in the QA audit
log's QA-P0-17 entry.

---

## 2026-09-26 — IDENTITY-P0-15/16 (Done), IDENTITY-P0-17 (Partial): the WonderID identity directory

WonderID Phase 1 (`docs/plan/WONDERID-ROADMAP.md`). This is one common
identity reference for every identity type, following spec rule R5 and
roadmap decision 1: a reference model, not a second source of truth.

### Schema (migrations 0077, 0078, 0079; applied live)

- **`identities`**:
  - One tenant-scoped row per identity. The types are HUMAN, EXTERNAL,
    MACHINE, SERVICE_ACCOUNT, APPLICATION, WORKLOAD, API and AI_AGENT.
  - Columns: status, human lifecycle state, source and correlation
    references, owner/sponsor/manager, HR fields, privileged/external flags,
    typed `attributes` jsonb.
  - Owner, sponsor, manager and agent are same-tenant composite foreign
    keys (the 0075/0076 pattern).
  - RLS on select, insert and update. There is no delete policy: an
    identity is disabled or archived, never deleted.
- **AI agents stay canonical in `agents`.** A SECURITY DEFINER trigger
  mirrors each agent 1:1:
  - it copies name, type, lifecycle as status, purpose, risk and last seen
    on insert or update;
  - deleting the agent cascades to its identity row.
  - The mirror row is kept out of the source-reference unique index,
    because `agents` has no uniqueness there and the mirror must never
    make an agent insert fail.
  - Nothing about `agents` changed.
- **Members are HUMAN identities.** A trigger on `tenant_memberships` (a
  Foundation table; read only here, nothing about it changed) does the
  following:
  - creates the member's identity on insert;
  - on a status change or delete, makes the identity inactive or active
    again;
  - keeps the row after the membership ends, because history and
    relationships matter after someone leaves.
  - Only rows it created (`source_system = 'wonderid'`) follow the
    membership.
- **Backfill:** 43/43 agents and 17/17 memberships got their identity rows.
- **`identity_attribute_definitions`**:
  - typed (string/number/boolean/date/enum), with required, sensitive,
    searchable and unique flags, allowed values and a format rule;
  - scoped to one identity type or all;
  - retired rather than deleted.
- **`identity_relationships`**:
  - manager_of, owns, sponsors, delegates_to, service_account_for,
    workload_runs_for and member_of;
  - valid_from/valid_to, source and confidence;
  - one current edge per (source, target, type).
- **Permissions:**
  - `identity.read` for TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN, IAM_ADMIN, IAM_ARCHITECT,
    SECURITY_ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUDITOR, CERTIFICATION_MANAGER and the
    owner roles;
  - `identity.manage` for TENANT_SUPER_ADMIN and IAM_ADMIN.
  - REQUESTER gets neither.
- **0078** revokes EXECUTE on the three trigger functions from
  anon/authenticated. The security advisor had listed them as RPC-callable
  (0077's `revoke ... from public` does not remove Supabase's default
  grants). Postgres refuses to run a trigger function outside a trigger,
  so this was exposure, not exploitability. Re-checked with
  `has_function_privilege`: anon and authenticated now have no EXECUTE on
  any of the three. The triggers still fire for member writes (the SQL
  test below ran after 0078).
- **0079** adds covering `(col, tenant_id)` indexes for every new
  composite foreign key, replacing single-column and tenant-first ones,
  plus `created_by` indexes. The performance advisor had listed them
  (§15). Re-checked with a catalog query: 0 foreign keys on the three
  tables lack a covering index.

### Rules (`modules/agent-identity/identityRules.ts`, pure, #9)

- AI agents are not created in the directory; they are registered under
  AI Agents.
- An external identity needs a sponsor, an organization and a future end
  date.
- Every machine identity type needs an owner.
- Owner, sponsor and manager must be active people in this organization,
  never the identity itself (checked in the service; the foreign keys hold
  the tenant rule).
- On update:
  - the type never changes;
  - an AI agent's identity accepts only owner, sponsor and attributes,
    because everything else comes from the agent;
  - a member's name and email come from their sign-in account;
  - an expired external identity can still be disabled, but not re-dated
    into the past.
- Attributes:
  - unknown keys are refused;
  - values are coerced to their type;
  - choice lists and format rules are enforced;
  - required ones must be present;
  - unique ones are checked against the tenant.

### Service, API and UI

- **Service:** `modules/agent-identity/directory.ts`, published through
  `service.ts`.
  - Every read and write filters on the request's tenant as well as RLS
    (the QA-P0-17 rule for two-organization members).
  - List and count are paged at the database, and counts run in parallel
    (§15).
  - 23503 maps to 404, 23505 to 409 and 23514 to 400.
  - Audit events: `identity.created`, `identity.updated`,
    `identity.status_changed`, `identity.relationship_added`,
    `identity.relationship_ended`, `identity.attribute_defined`,
    `identity.attribute_retired` and `identity.attribute_restored`. They
    carry field names only, never values (#10, §17.7).
- **API:** `/api/v1/identities` (GET, POST), `/:id` (GET, PATCH),
  `/:id/relationships` (GET, POST), `/relationships/:id` (DELETE, which
  ends the edge), `/attributes` (GET, POST) and `/attributes/:id` (PATCH
  `active`). A body `tenantId` is ignored.
- **UI:**
  - `/identities` overview: counts by type, plus the "needs attention"
    gaps (machines without an owner, external access ending in 30 days or
    already past its end date).
  - Lists: `/identities/all`, `/humans`, `/external` and `/machines`, with
    search, status filter and database paging.
  - `/identities/new`, whose fields follow the chosen type.
  - `/identities/[id]` with Overview, Relationships, Attributes and Edit
    tabs. An AI agent's identity links to the agent.
  - `/identities/attributes` (Administration → Identity Attributes).
  - Sensitive attribute values are hidden from viewers without
    `identity.manage`.
  - Navigation: the Identities section now lists Overview, All, People,
    External, Machine and Non-human Identities.

### Deliberately left out (IDENTITY-P0-17 stays Partial)

- **Groups:** there is no group model yet; that is Phase 2/4 data.
- **Detail tabs Access, Risk and Activity** for non-agent identities: they
  need the account/access correlation of ACCESS-P0-17/24.
- **Identity search** beyond the list's name/email/account search.
- **Provenance** beyond source and audit.
- **Deferred to IDENTITY-P0-18:** the "past end date" count is shown but
  not acted on; lifecycle transitions (joiner/mover/leaver) belong to that
  story.

### Verified

- `tsc` and `eslint` clean.
- Unit tests: `identityRules.test.ts` 20/20. vitest total **556/556**; `eslint .` clean.
- Live SQL (`tests/identity/unified-identities-isolation.sql`), 18/18:
  - the negative cases: a tenant-A member sees 0 tenant-B identities and
    definitions, and inserts into B are denied (42501);
  - updates of B rows affect 0 rows, and deletes affect 0 rows;
  - cross-tenant owner and relationship references are 23503;
  - an AI_AGENT row with no agent is 23514, and a duplicate current edge
    is 23505;
  - the mirror and the membership sync work for a member write.
- E2E `identities.spec.ts`, 16/16:
  - the type rules through the API;
  - a machine cannot be owned by a machine;
  - the AI agent mirror (not renameable here, owner settable);
  - attribute enforcement;
  - relationships (add, 409 on a duplicate, 400 on a self-edge, end, 404
    on a second end);
  - UI create;
  - overview links;
  - another organization: 404 on read, update and reference, absent from
    the list, "not found" page;
  - read-only can browse but cannot create (403), and REQUESTER gets 403.
- design-review (5 new routes at 8 widths and both themes) and
  navigation-smoke: 51/51.
- Full Playwright suite (§17.8: migrations, RLS and the shell changed):
  **212/212 passed** (10.5 min, fresh build, with 0077–0079 live).
- Screenshots checked: overview (light), machines (dark), detail edit
  (light), new-external and all-identities at 390 px. One fix came from
  them: the search box got a visible label so it lines up with the status
  filter.

## 2026-09-26 — Sourced identity writes and field provenance (for INTEGRATION-P0-09)

Identity sources (Integration module) need to change identities. This
module keeps sole ownership of those writes (#5, #6) and publishes the
write path. The full pipeline is in the Integration audit (same date).

- **Migration 0080:** `identities.field_provenance` jsonb. It records which
  source set each field, at what precedence and when. It is checked to be
  an object and applied live.
- **`sourcedMerge.ts` (pure):**
  - a source's authoritative field is written unless a higher-precedence
    source set it last;
  - other fields only fill blanks;
  - ties go to the incoming source, so it can correct its own value.
  - A manual edit leaves provenance alone, so the owning source's next
    import restores its value (#7: the source stays the system of record).
- **`sourcedIdentities.ts`** (published through `service.ts`):
  - `listIdentitiesForCorrelation()`;
  - `applySourcedIdentities(tenantId, authority, ops)` with `create`,
    `update` and `leaver` ops. It uses the service role (runs execute after
    the request); every statement is tenant-filtered, and every target row
    is re-read inside the tenant first.
  - Each op succeeds or fails on its own and reports why.
  - Person lifecycle follows the sourced status: pending or future start →
    PRE_JOIN; inactive → DISABLED; terminated → TERMINATED. A leaver
    becomes inactive with LEAVE_PENDING.
  - AI agents are never created by a source.
  - Audit: `identity.created`, `identity.updated`,
    `identity.status_changed` and `identity.leaver_detected`, with actor
    type `integration` and the run id as correlation. Field names only.
- **Tests:** precedence unit tests are in
  `modules/integrations/identitySourceRules.test.ts`. E2E coverage is in
  `identity-sources.spec.ts`: an authoritative field is set; a
  lower-precedence source cannot overwrite it; managers resolve; leavers go
  to LEAVE_PENDING.

---

## 2026-09-26 — IDENTITY-P0-18 (Partial): human lifecycle, joiner to leaver, with governed work

WonderID Phase 2. Lifecycle events are recorded and each opens governed
tasks. They come from identity sources (INTEGRATION-P0-09) or from a
person's transition. Following spec "Human lifecycle", nothing is granted
or revoked by itself (#15).

### Schema (migration 0084; applied live)

- **`identity_lifecycle_events`**:
  - event types: joiner, mover, leaver, rehire, conversion,
    manager_change, leaver_cancelled, disabled, terminated, archived and
    hire_cancelled;
  - from/to state, changed fields;
  - origin (source or manual), plus the source and run ids;
  - actor and note.
- **`identity_lifecycle_tasks`**:
  - task types: request_baseline_access, review_access,
    transfer_ownership, revoke_access and disable_sign_in;
  - status open, done or skipped;
  - an assignee (the person's manager for access work);
  - a resolution note, required when skipped (a check constraint), and
    completion by and at.
- Same-tenant composite FKs throughout. RLS: members read, and insert and
  update through the service. There is no delete policy: lifecycle history
  is evidence.

### Rules (`humanLifecycle.ts`, pure, 8 unit tests)

- A first manager is an assignment, not a `manager_change`. A joiner's
  manager is resolved in the run's second pass, so when a person gets
  their first manager, their open, unassigned access tasks go to that
  manager, who is then told. The E2E run found this.

- **Transitions:**
  - PRE_JOIN → ACTIVE (join) or ARCHIVED (hire cancelled);
  - ACTIVE → LEAVE_PENDING (leaver) or DISABLED;
  - LEAVE_PENDING → ACTIVE (departure cancelled) or DISABLED;
  - DISABLED → TERMINATED or ACTIVE (rehire);
  - TERMINATED → ARCHIVED or ACTIVE (rehire);
  - ARCHIVED → ACTIVE (rehire).
- **Status follows state.** LEAVE_PENDING keeps the current status:
  someone serving notice still works.
- **Detection from a sourced change:**
  - new person → joiner;
  - start date reached → joiner;
  - department, title, business unit or location → mover;
  - manager only → manager_change;
  - employment type or subtype → conversion;
  - gone → leaver;
  - back → rehire.
  - Someone who has gone does not "move".
- **Tasks:**
  - joiner → request baseline access;
  - mover or conversion → review access;
  - rehire → both;
  - leaver → transfer ownership, revoke access, and disable sign-in (only
    for people who can sign in).

### Service (`humanLifecycleService.ts`)

- **Sourced changes** are recorded by `applySourcedIdentities()` after the
  identity change itself. A recording failure is reported on the result,
  never hidden and never undoing the change.
- **Manual transitions:**
  - they need `identity.manage` and must be an allowed transition;
  - leaver, disable, terminate and cancel-hire need a reason;
  - optimistic concurrency: the change applies only if the state is still
    what it was, else 409.
- **Closing a task** needs a note to skip. "Done" on an ownership transfer
  is refused while the person still owns anything.
- **Ownership transfer** moves everything to an active person, then closes
  the task:
  - identities owned, sponsored and managed;
  - current owns/sponsors/manager_of relationships (history kept);
  - AI agents owned, through `assignOwner`/`removeOwner`, which requires a
    receiving person who can sign in. Delegated ownership is left to
    expire.
- **The manager is told** through the new `lifecycle_task` notification
  (Operations migration 0085).
- **Audit:** `identity.lifecycle_event`, `identity.lifecycle_task_closed`
  and `identity.ownership_transferred`.

### API and UI

- **API:**
  - `/api/v1/identities/:id/lifecycle` (GET history and tasks; POST
    transition);
  - `/api/v1/identities/lifecycle-tasks` (GET, open by default);
  - `/lifecycle-tasks/:id` (POST transfer, done or skipped).
- **UI:**
  - a **Lifecycle** tab on people (state, next step with a reason, open
    work with transfer/done/not-needed, history), reachable as
    `?tab=lifecycle`;
  - **Identities → Lifecycle Work**, the organization's queue;
  - the overview's "needs attention" counts open lifecycle work.

### Deliberately left out (story stays Partial)

- **No automatic birthright grants or deprovisioning.** Access packages
  are ACCESS-P0-20 and the provisioning pipeline is INTEGRATION-P0-13.
  Until then, "request baseline access" and "revoke access" are tracked
  tasks a person closes.
- **Disable sign-in** points to membership suspension (Foundation). It
  does not suspend by itself.
- Legal and retention holds: not implemented.

### Verified

- `tsc` and `eslint .` clean.
- vitest **582/582**, including `humanLifecycle.test.ts` 8/8.
- Live SQL (`tests/identity/human-lifecycle-isolation.sql`), 9/9:
  - a tenant-A member sees 0 of B's events and tasks;
  - their writes into B are denied (42501), and closing a B task affects
    0 rows;
  - cross-tenant events and tasks are 23503;
  - a skip without a note, and a close without a completion time, are
    23514.
  - Fixtures were cleaned up.
- E2E `human-lifecycle.spec.ts`, 13/13 (with setup):
  - a source joiner, with the task assigned to the manager, who was
    resolved in the same run;
  - a source mover gets an access review;
  - a source leaver gets ownership and access tasks, and no sign-in task
    for someone who cannot sign in;
  - the ownership transfer:
    - "done" is refused while the person still owns things;
    - the leaver cannot be the new owner;
    - the service account moves;
    - a second attempt is 409;
  - skipping needs a note;
  - manual transitions: an invalid step is 409, a missing reason is 400,
    and disable → rehire opens tasks;
  - a machine identity has no lifecycle;
  - the Lifecycle tab closes a task, and the queue lists it;
  - another organization gets 404 and sees nothing;
  - read-only gets 403.
- Screenshots checked (Lifecycle tab at desktop, and at 390 px dark; the
  queue). Fixes that came from them:
  - "lifecycleState" noise removed from the history;
  - an empty-ownership message;
  - the queue says when it shows only the latest 200.
- Full Playwright suite (§17.8): **229/229 passed** (12.6 min, 0084/0085
  live).

## 2026-09-26 — `getIdentityForUser` (published for ACCESS-P0-18, additive)

- `getIdentityForUser(tenantId, userId)` returns the tenant's HUMAN identity
  linked to that signed-in user, or null. It reads as the user, with the
  tenant filtered. It is exported from `modules/agent-identity/service.ts`.
- Access uses it to know who "me" is when a person requests access for
  themselves.
- No existing caller changed. Verified by `request-catalog.spec` (requests
  for yourself resolve the requester's identity).

### 2026-10-10 — Sourced identities: native ids and a preview of a merge

For the object-page CSV import (preview, then additive import; user
decision, 2026-10-10). All changes are additive; no existing caller changed.

- `listIdentitiesForCorrelation()` also returns `sourceNativeId`, so a later
  import of the same record finds the identity it created.
- A `create` op may carry `nativeId`. It is stored as `source_native_id`
  under `source_system = "File imports"`, guarded by the existing unique
  index `(tenant, source_system, source_native_id)`.
- `previewSourcedIdentities(tenantId, authority, ops)` is new and reads only.
  - It applies `mergeSourcedFields` to the same rows that
    `applySourcedIdentities` would update, and returns each op's changes
    (field, from, to) and the fields kept by precedence.
  - It writes nothing.
- File imports write with precedence 1000, the lowest, so an authoritative
  source such as HR keeps the fields it owns. The preview shows those as
  "kept by a source of record".
- Verified: the agent-identity suite is green within the 617-test run
  recorded in the Integration log; typecheck clean.

### 2026-10-10 — Record provenance columns (Foundation migration 0115, owner request)

Foundation's migration 0115 added `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`
and `updated_by` (where missing) and the `record_provenance` trigger to this
module's object tables: `agents`, `agent_identities`, `agent_contracts`, `agent_owners`, `agent_relationships`, `agent_duplicate_candidates`, `identities`, `identity_relationships`, `identity_lifecycle_tasks`, `identity_attribute_definitions`, `identity_source_links`. Additive; no service changed. The rule is
CLAUDE.md §19.10; the mechanism and its verification are in the Foundation
log, the page work in the Experience log. A new object table of this module
follows the same pattern and joins `lib/provenance/tables.ts`.

### 2026-10-10 — Reads the organization's Global Configuration (owner request)

`modules/agent-identity/duplicates.ts`: the duplicate match threshold is the organization's setting (`agents.duplicateMatchPercent`, default 60%). Defaults equal the previous constants. Cross-module change by explicit
owner request; the mechanism is Foundation's `lib/config` (CLAUDE.md §19.11,
Foundation log).

## 2026-10-11 — Non-human identities from accounts (IDENTITY-P0-20, F1, #46)

Service, shared, machine, workload, application and API accounts found by a
connector now become governed identities with an owner, or wait in a queue
until they have one. An agent's accounts link to the agent by identifiers
the agent declares.

**What changed.** No migration; `identities` already has
`owner_identity_id` and a unique `(tenant, source_system, source_native_id)`.
- `accountIdentities.ts`:
  - `ensureAccountIdentities()` finds or creates the identity for each
    non-human account (source `account:<applicationId>`, the account key as
    its native id). It sets the owner the source names when the identity has
    none, and never replaces an owner set in WonderID. Audited
    `identity.created_from_accounts`; service role with the tenant on every
    statement.
  - `listAgentIdentifiers()` reads `agent_identities.external_reference`,
    leaving out human delegates; an identifier two agents declare links
    neither.
- `accountIdentityRules.resolveOwner()` (pure): one person by WonderID id,
  source id, email or username; unknown or ambiguous names nobody, so there
  is no guessed owner.
- Onboarding › Unowned Identities (`/identities/unowned`, `identity.read`):
  non-human identities with no owner. With `identity.manage`, Assign uses
  `updateIdentity` (audited `identity.updated`).
- `listIdentities()` gains an `unownedNonHuman` filter.
- Access (recorded in its audit log): account reconciliation calls both;
  access requests refuse an unowned non-human subject.

**Verified.**
- `accountIdentityRules.test.ts` 2.
- Access rule tests (below).
- Full suite 1191/1191.
- Typecheck, eslint and `next build` are clean.

**Left out.**
- Configurable rules for which accounts are non-human: the source's
  `accountType` decides for now.
- Owner changes from the source after an owner is set: WonderID's owner
  wins.

### 2026-10-11 — Sourced custom attributes (for INTEGRATION-P0-20)

Identity's published write path for identity sources now writes custom
attributes. The change is additive: existing callers are unchanged.

- `SourcedOp` create and update take an optional `attributes` (name → text).
  `SourcedResult` reports `attributesChanged`.
- `SourceAuthority.ownsAttributes`: the source is the system of record for
  the attributes it maps (an authoritative source).
- `sourcedMerge.ts`: one merge rule for fields and attributes (the existing
  `mergeSourcedFields()` behaviour is unchanged).
  - `mergeSourcedAttributes()` applies the same precedence, with provenance
    under `attributes.<name>`.
  - `coerceSourcedAttributes()` types the values with `validateAttributes()`,
    except that a source need not send every required attribute. It leaves
    out retired attributes and those for other identity types, and turns a
    blank into null, which clears an owned value.
- `applySourcedIdentities()`:
  - reads the definitions once per call (service role, filtered on the
    tenant);
  - refuses a record whose value is invalid, or whose unique value another
    identity or another record in the same run holds. That record is
    reported as an error; nothing of it is applied;
  - writes `identities.attributes` and `field_provenance`. Audit metadata
    lists attribute names, never values.

**Verified.** Unit tests for typing and merge (+3); the identity-sources E2E
test above. The unchanged precedence tests still pass.

### 2026-10-11 — Owned identities for requests (for ACCESS-P0-31)

`listOwnedIdentities(tenantId, userId, identityId)` (published in
`modules/agent-identity/service.ts`) lists the active identities a person
may request access for as their owner: non-human identities whose owner is
their identity, and the AI agents they are business owner of. It reads as
the user (RLS), filtered on the tenant, at most 100 rows. The request form
uses it for "For". No schema change.

**Verified.** Typecheck; the ACCESS-P0-31 E2E test (the owner's service
account and agent appear under "For").

### 2026-10-11 — Direct reports for requests (for EXPERIENCE-P0-29)

`listDirectReports(tenantId, identityId)` (published in
`modules/agent-identity/service.ts`) lists the active people whose manager is
the given identity, at most 100. It reads as the user (RLS), filtered on the
tenant. The request form lists them under "People you manage". No schema
change.

### 2026-10-12 — Automation members create no person identity (for FOUNDATION-P0-31)

Migration 0127 (Foundation) replaces `identity_sync_membership()` with the
same body plus one guard: a membership with `account_type = 'automation'`
creates no HUMAN identity. Such a membership is the backing member of an
automation credential, which is governed through the APPLICATION identity
it belongs to. Every other membership behaves as before; the status trigger
is unchanged (it finds no identity to update for an automation member).
Verified by `tests/foundation/automation-credentials-isolation.sql`
("automation membership creates a person identity", 0).

### 2026-10-12 — A person's departure opens their access removals (WID-C02)

`recordLifecycleEvents` now calls the Access Agent's published
`openLeaverRemovals` when an event takes a person to disabled, terminated
or archived for the first time. The pure rule is `opensAccessRemoval` in
`humanLifecycle.ts`. Serving notice (LEAVE_PENDING) does not trigger it,
and later steps do not trigger it again.

The Access service is loaded at call time, because it already imports
this module's service. The `revoke_access` lifecycle task stays as the
person-level checklist, and each removal is its own fulfilment task, done
by a person.

Verified:
- `humanLifecycle.test.ts` (new `opensAccessRemoval` cases);
- E2E `human-lifecycle.spec.ts` 7/7 and `leaver-removals.spec.ts` 2/2.

Tracked in `docs/WonderID/FINDINGS-REMEDIATION.md`.

### 2026-10-12 — `agents.gateway_only` (WID-C03, owner decision)

- Migration 0144 (applied) adds `agents.gateway_only` (default false).
  `Agent.gatewayOnly` is mapped.
- `setAgentGatewayOnly` (`agents.ts`): runs under the caller's session
  (RLS) with an explicit tenant filter; audited as
  `agent.gateway_only_changed`.
- `PUT /api/v1/agents/{id}/gateway-only` and `setGatewayOnlyAction`, both
  requiring `runtime.emergency` (turning it on arms an automatic
  suspension).
- The agent page shows it folded in the API keys card: "Gateway only:
  on/off", with one button.

### 2026-10-12 — disagreements between identity sources (WID-H01, owner decision)

The owner kept the source-priority rule and asked for a conflict list.
- Migrations 0146 and 0147 (applied): `identity_source_conflicts`, one open
  row per person, field and disagreeing source, with both values and
  sources. RLS select under the identities rule; no client write policy;
  same-tenant composite foreign keys to `identities` and `identity_sources`.
- `mergeSourced` now also returns `disagreements` (an owned field a
  higher-priority source set to something else). The pure
  `planDisagreements` decides what opens, refreshes and resolves.
- `applySourcedIdentities` reads the open rows for the people in the batch
  once, then writes per person. It resolves a row when the disagreeing
  source agrees again, or when the owning source moves to its value.
  Audited as `identity.source_disagreements_changed`, with field names
  only. A failure is put on the result (`conflictsError`) and never undoes
  the change.
- The preview's `skipped` keeps its old shape (field and reason only).
- `listSourceDisagreements` (RLS, tenant filter) is published through the
  service.

Verified:
- `npm run typecheck`, eslint on the changed files, `npm run build`:
  clean;
- `npx vitest run modules/integrations modules/agent-identity`: 458
  passed;
- E2E `identity-sources.spec.ts`, local: 18 passed;
- `tests/integration/identity-sources-isolation.sql` against the dev
  project: 19/19 checks as expected. Its fixture cleanup call was
  cancelled twice; the two fixture tenants (`fixture-tenant-a81-test`,
  `fixture-tenant-b81-test`) remain until the cleanup lines are run.

Not done here: unlink with undo (the next WID-H01 item).

### 2026-10-12 — unlink a source record, with undo (WID-H01, owner decision)

- Migration 0148 (applied): `identity_source_changes` (this module) and
  `identity_source_rejections` (Integration). Both have RLS select under
  the tenant rule, no client write policy, and same-tenant composite
  foreign keys.
- `applySourcedIdentities` records each value it changes on an existing
  identity (update and leaver paths) before it applies the change. If the
  history insert fails, the record fails and nothing is changed.
- `revertSourceRecord` (service role, explicit tenant filters): the pure
  `planRevert` restores each field the record changed to its value before
  the record's first change, with that value's provenance. A field changed
  since is kept and named. A restored status recomputes the person's
  lifecycle state, with no lifecycle event. The identity is written only if
  `updated_at` is unchanged since it was read. Audited as
  `identity.source_changes_undone` (field names only).
- The identity page shows "Source records (n)", folded, with Unlink for
  `identity.manage` (it asks first). The server action is
  `unlinkSourceRecordAction`.

Verified:
- typecheck, eslint on the changed files, `npm run build`: clean;
- `identitySourceRules.test.ts` 43 with the architecture tests (planRevert
  3, correlate with rejections 1);
- E2E: see the Integration entry.

Not run: the 0148 checks added to
`tests/integration/identity-sources-isolation.sql`. Database writes
through the SQL tool were cancelled this session, so they wait for a
session that can write (with the fixture cleanup noted in the previous
entry).

### 2026-10-12 — fix: file imports could not update people (regression from #126/#127)

`applySourcedIdentities` now records value history and source
disagreements only when the authority is one of the organization's
identity sources (`identitySourceExists`).

A file import passes its connection's id as the source. Since #127 the
history insert broke its foreign key for every change it made, so each
updated person failed ("updated 0"). The #126 disagreement writes failed
the same way, though only as a reported error. File imports have no
source record to unlink, so they record neither.

Found by E2E `file-import.spec.ts` in the investigation of the 12 October
nightly. Verified:
- `npx vitest run modules/agent-identity modules/integrations
  modules/certification-compliance`: 519 passed;
- E2E `file-import` and `identity-sources`: passed.
### 2026-10-12 — WID-H07 (owner decision)

Typed text out of audit records: agent lifecycle reasons (kept on `agent_lifecycle_events`), the identity link basis (now kept in `agent_identities.link_basis`, migration 0150) and contract updates (the audit now names version ids and numbers, not the contract text). See the Foundation entry for the mechanism.

### 2026-10-12 — WID-H07, identifiers only

WID-H07 identifiers only: `agent.identity_linked` fingerprints `externalReference` (a delegate's login, say), which is kept on the link. `identity.source_changes_undone` fingerprints the source record's `externalId`.

### 2026-10-13 — IDENTITY-P0-18 done: birthright on join, rehire and move

`recordLifecycleEvents` calls Access's `assignBirthrightPackages` when
`opensBirthright(event)` holds. That is a joiner, rehire or mover whose
state after the event is ACTIVE. A joiner before their start date gets the
packages with the PRE_JOIN → ACTIVE joiner event.

A failure is audited (`access.package_birthright_assigned`, failure). The
event and the manager's baseline-access task stay, as the way in.

With the leaver work of 12 October (removal tasks, connector disable),
the story's last parts are built; the tracker row is Done.

Tests:
- `humanLifecycle.test.ts`, "opensBirthright";
- E2E `birthright.spec.ts` and `human-lifecycle.spec.ts`.
See the Access log for the rest.

## 2026-10-14 — IDENTITY-P0-17 done: Groups, Risk and Activity on the identity page

**What was built.** The identity page gained three tabs, each shown only when it applies and the viewer may see it.
- **Groups:** the WonderID groups of the identity's user, with each group's roles. Only for an identity linked to a user. Uses Foundation's `groupsOfUser`.
- **Risk:** findings about the identity, open first. That is rogue access on its accounts, linking to the finding page, and, for an AI agent's identity, the agent's own findings. Shown with `risk.read`; served by Risk's new `listIdentityFindings`, which reads with the caller's client plus the tenant filter.
- **Activity:** the latest 50 audit events about the identity, its user account and its AI agent, with a link to the full audit log. Shown with `audit.read`; served by Operations' new `listObjectActivity`, through the caller's client (RLS) plus the tenant filter.

The Access tab already existed (ACCESS-P0-24). Lifecycle events and tasks stay on the Lifecycle tab.

**Verified.** Typecheck, eslint and `next build` clean. Local E2E identities 18/18, including a new test that opens the Groups, Risk and Activity tabs on a person's page. That spec already proves another organization's admin gets a 404 on the page.

## 2026-10-14 — IDENTITY-P0-21: attribute rules on the shared rule runtime

Attribute rules, the "user update rules" of the Saviynt study (design
§5.2.1), set an identity's attribute from its other attributes. They run when
the identity is created in WonderID, imported from a source, or when an
attribute changes. Operations' shared runtime (D12) evaluates them; the rules
themselves belong to Identity.

- **Migration 0166.**
  - `lifecycle_rules` (kind `attribute` now, `lifecycle` with IDENTITY-P0-18's
    finish) holds a working copy and the published copy that runs.
  - `lifecycle_rule_versions` holds every published version with who asked and
    who approved, and is append-only.
  - Members read; service-role writes are filtered by tenant. The database
    refuses an approval by the person who asked. A publish request clears
    `published_by`, which then means "approved this request". This lets the
    previous approver ask for the next version; the version table keeps
    every approver.
- **Logic** (`attributeRules.ts`, pure).
  - **What a rule reads:** the identity's standard fields and custom
    attributes, its manager's, and for a change the old and new values.
  - **What a rule sets:** only descriptive standard fields (display name,
    department, title, business unit, location, employment type,
    organization, purpose) and that type's custom attributes. It never sets
    status, lifecycle, ownership or access.
  - **Values:** fixed, a reference, or a template such as
    `{identity.firstName} {identity.lastName}`.
  - **Sources win (NN #7).** A rule never overrides a value a connected
    source set; the write is skipped and logged.
  - **Provenance.** A value a rule writes carries `rule:<id>` provenance
    with the rule version, at the lowest precedence, so the next
    authoritative import replaces it.
  - **Unique attributes.** A unique attribute that another identity already
    holds is skipped.
- **Service** (`identityRulesService.ts`):
  - create, edit (the working copy only; it withdraws a pending request and
    must be simulated again), simulate, request publish, approve publish
    (four-eyes), retire;
  - `simulateIdentityRule` runs the working copy over every identity in
    scope, a page of 1,000 at a time up to 50,000, and reports who would
    change, from what to what, and what a source's value keeps from changing;
  - `applyIdentityRules` runs the published copies, writes enforced results
    with an optimistic check on `updated_at`, logs every rule's outcome to
    Operations' run log, and audits `identity.rules_applied` with names only.
    It never throws, and a failure never undoes the change that triggered it;
  - a rule's own writes start no further rules.
- **Hooks.**
  - `createIdentity` fires `identity.created`.
  - `updateIdentity` fires `identity.attribute_changed` with the changed
    standard and custom fields.
  - `applySourcedIdentities` fires `identity.imported` for creations and
    `identity.attribute_changed` for changes, once the batch is written, with
    the rules read once per batch. Results carry `rulesApplied` and
    `rulesError`.
- **API.** `/api/v1/identities/rules`, `rules/:id`, `rules/:id/simulate`,
  `rules/:id/publish` (`request` or `approve`), `rules/:id/retire` and
  `rules/:id/runs`. Reads need `identity.read`, writes `identity.manage`.
- **Pages.**
  - `/identities/rules` lists the rules, with "New rule" folded.
  - `/identities/rules/:id` shows what the rule does and one next step
    (simulate, ask to publish, approve, or waiting), plus recent runs.
    Editing and retiring are folded.
  - The Admin sidebar has "Identity Rules" next to Identity Attributes.

**Left for IDENTITY-P0-18's finish.** Lifecycle rules: the triggers activated,
manager changed, moved, leaver and end date reached, and the effects beyond
setting attributes (packages, groups, tasks, lifecycle transitions).

**Verified.**
- Unit tests: `attributeRules.test.ts`, 14 passed. These cover what a rule
  sees, writes with rule provenance, a source's value never overridden, its
  own earlier value replaceable, invalid and unknown attributes skipped, a
  later rule winning, input shapes, published versus working copies, and
  definitions compared regardless of key order.
- Database: `tests/identity/lifecycle-rules-isolation.sql`, 12 of 12 as
  expected.
- E2E: `tests/e2e/identity-rules.spec.ts`, 15 of 15. It covers:
  - unknown attributes, status and package effects refused;
  - no publishing before a simulation; self-approval refused; another
    administrator approves;
  - in report-only mode the run log says "reported" and nothing changes;
  - after an edit to enforce, the rule must be simulated and approved again;
    then the value is written with `rule:<id>` provenance at version 2 and
    logged as "applied", and someone outside the condition is left alone;
  - the pages work, and a retired rule stops running;
  - another organization gets 404 on everything and an empty run log;
    read-only gets 403 on writes.
- `identities.spec.ts`: 21 of 21 passed in the same run. Creating and editing
  identities now runs rules.
- Typecheck, eslint and `next build` are clean.

**Bugs the E2E found before merge.**
- The simulation read only the first 2,000 identities by id, and the shared
  E2E organization has 2,291. It now pages through all of them.
- Approving left the publish request set, so the page still showed "Waiting
  for approval".
- Definitions were compared as JSON text, but stored JSON comes back with its
  keys reordered, so every published rule showed unpublished changes and
  "already published" could never be detected. They are now compared
  regardless of key order.

## 2026-10-14 — IDENTITY-P0-18 (finish): expiry and the manager's "disable all access"

The finish row lists birthright, mover, leaver, expiry, four-eyes publish and
the manager's "disable all access". Birthright on join, rehire and move (0151,
four-eyes), the mover review (WID-H09, 0153) and leaver removal (WID-C02) were
already built. Four-eyes publishing of configurable rules came with
IDENTITY-P0-21. This entry adds the two pieces that were missing.

- **Expiry.**
  - **The sweep:** `sweepEndDates` moves every working person (HUMAN or
    EXTERNAL, ACTIVE) whose end date has passed to LEAVE_PENDING. An end date
    is the last day, so it has passed only once today is later.
  - **What it opens:** a leaver event with origin `schedule` and the note
    "End date YYYY-MM-DD reached", which opens the usual leaver tasks
    (ownership transfer, access removal, and sign-in when the person has
    one), and their manager is told.
  - **What it doesn't do:** revoke anything itself. Removal opens when a
    person disables them (WID-C02).
  - **When it runs:** daily via `/api/cron/identity-lifecycle` at 04:45 UTC,
    before access governance's 05:00 sweep, and on viewing Joiner-Mover-Leaver
    for that organization (the existing "views sweep their own tenant"
    pattern).
  - **Safety:** every write is filtered by the row's tenant and only while
    the person is still ACTIVE, so it runs once.
  - **Migration 0168:**
    - widens `identity_lifecycle_events.origin` with `schedule`, which is
      additive;
    - indexes active people's end dates.
  - **Before deploying:** nobody in any organization had a passed end date,
    so the first run moves no one in bulk.
- **The manager's "disable all access".**
  - **Who:** `disableAllAccess` lets a person's own current manager, or an
    identity administrator, disable a working or leaving person with a reason.
    Never themselves, and only people.
  - **What it does:** DISABLED opens the leaver removal work: every grant
    becomes a governed removal, and accounts are disabled through their
    connectors.
  - **How authority is checked:** the manager link is read from the database,
    never from the request. A manager need not hold `identity.manage`, so the
    write uses the service role, filtered on tenant and on the state that was
    read.
  - **Audit:** `identity.access_disabled`, saying whether the actor acted as
    manager or administrator, with the reason as typed text.
  - **Route:** `POST /api/v1/identities/:id/disable-access`, gated by
    `requireAnyPermission(["identity.manage", "access.request"])`.
  - **UI:** a new **My Team** page (My Access › My Team, `access.read`) lists
    the viewer's direct reports, with "Disable all access" folded on each
    working or leaving one.
  - **Small changes elsewhere:** `listDirectReports` returns title, lifecycle
    state and end date too, which is additive. The identity page labels
    scheduled events "on schedule".

**Left out:** configurable lifecycle-rule effects (packages, groups, tasks,
transitions on lifecycle triggers) stay under IDENTITY-P0-21. The built-in
policies above cover the finish row.

**Verified.**
- Unit tests: `humanLifecycle.test.ts`, 13 passed, including the end-date
  rule and who may disable.
- Local E2E: `lifecycle-expiry-disable.spec.ts` with `human-lifecycle.spec.ts`,
  18/18 including setup. The new spec covers:
  - refused for someone who is not your report, yourself, a blank reason,
    read-only (403) and another organization (404), with nothing changed;
  - the requester (a manager) disables their report from My Team; the event
    records "disabled" with the reason, the audit records "as manager", and
    a second attempt gets 409;
  - an external whose end date passed yesterday becomes LEAVE_PENDING with a
    `schedule` leaver event and its tasks, and viewing again adds nothing.
- Typecheck, eslint and `next build` are clean.

## 2026-10-14 — Review info for COMPLIANCE-P0-10

Published `getIdentityReviewInfo(tenantId, ids)` (`directory.ts`, exported
from `service.ts`): for each identity, its signed-in user, its manager's
identity and its owner's identity, read with the service role and filtered
by `tenant_id` explicitly. Compliance uses it to pick each item's
reviewer and to refuse self-certification. No schema change in this
module. Verified through Compliance's checks.

## 2026-10-14 — Person identities for role reviews (COMPLIANCE-P0-11)

Published `getHumanIdentityIdsForUsers(tenantId, userIds)` (`directory.ts`,
exported from `service.ts`): each member's HUMAN identity in the
organization, service role, filtered by `tenant_id`. Compliance uses it to
make each role-review item about the person. No schema change.

## 2026-10-14 — Identity pages open at their numbers (FOUNDATION-P0-34 part 2)

CLAUDE.md §19.13: an identity's page is `/identities/<number>` and an
identity rule's is `/identities/rules/<number>` (`ref`, migration 0192),
never the UUID.

- Pages: `identities/[id]` and `identities/rules/[ruleId]` resolve the
  number with `pageRef` (within the session's tenant, as the user); an old
  UUID link redirects to the number, keeping `?tab=`.
- Data: `Identity.ref` (shared type, optional, additive) from `toIdentity`;
  `ref` in `listIdentities`' columns, `getIdentityNames` (so relationship,
  owner/sponsor/manager, correlation and leaver-report links use it),
  `LifecycleTaskView.identityRef`, `SourceDisagreementRow.identityRef`,
  `IdentityRule.ref`, `DiscoveryInboxEntry.integrationRef`.
- Links switched to the number: the directory tables, unowned queue,
  lifecycle work list, the identity page's own links, a member's page
  (`settings/users/[userId]`), the leaver-removal report, the rules list
  and the new-rule redirect. Creating an identity redirects to its number;
  the identity actions revalidate `/identities/[id]` as a route pattern.
- The agent discovery candidate page (`agents/discovery/[integrationId]/…`)
  takes the connection's number; runtime sources keep their own key; an
  old UUID link redirects.
- Left as UUID links (they redirect): links from access pages
  (requests, packages, accounts, applications), certification items and a
  rule's run list (the run log is Operations', it holds only the UUID).

Verified: typecheck clean; eslint on the changed files clean (one
existing warning in `app/actions/connectors.ts`); Vitest
`modules/agent-identity`, `modules/integrations`, `modules/operations`,
`modules/access-governance`, `lib/refs`, `app` 108 files / 1098 tests
passed (new: a discovery candidate from a connection links by the
connection's number); `next build` clean.
Local E2E on port 3300 (`next build`, shared E2E organization, three
agents' suites running at once): every new URL assertion passed in at least
one run: identity create → number, old identity UUID → number (also with
`?tab=lifecycle`), directory links numeric, source page and CSV run URLs,
connection create/upgrade URLs (`integrations` 12/12 in the last run,
`connection-upgrade`, `mcp-bridge`), discovery record → number and UUID
redirect, policy create → number. The rule page, policy and discovery-
candidate redirects were also checked directly (UUID → `NEXT_REDIRECT` to
the number; unknown number → 404). Remaining failures in those runs were
API timeouts under load (e.g. `POST /api/v1/identities` took 13–16 s on
this and on another agent's main-based server alike), CSV runs still
`running` at 30 s, sign-in setup timeouts, and one pre-existing duplicate
`ledger://fy2026` text in `mcp-inventory`; none involves these pages. The
nightly run is the full check.


## 2026-10-14 — Agent pages at the agent's number (FOUNDATION-P0-34, part 2)

Owner decision (CLAUDE.md §19.13). `/agents/[id]`, `/access/agents/[agentId]`,
`/runtime/agents/[agentId]`, `/risk/agents/[agentId]` and
`/risk/rogue/[agentId]` resolve the agent's number with `pageRef()` (404 for an
unknown number; an old UUID link redirects). The overview page resolves the
tenant first, then runs the scoped `agent.read` check on the resolved agent as
before (FOUNDATION-P0-19). `Agent.ref` added (`toAgent`); `AgentTabs` takes
`agentRef`; the primary and rogue action bars, the agents list, the NHI
inventory (`nhi.ts`, with a unit test), the home dashboard, runtime and risk
lists, search results and agent reports link by number. Registering an agent
and the agent server actions redirect to the number.

Left as UUID links (they redirect): related-agent links, duplicate review and
discovery "matched agent" links, links from other areas holding only an
agent id (identity detail, campaigns, SoD conflicts, access requests).

E2E: a support helper (`tests/e2e/support/objectRefs.ts`) reads the number
from the URL and the UUID through the agents API; 17 specs updated, and
agents.spec asserts the four sections' number URLs, that an old UUID link
redirects on all five agent pages, and that an unknown number is not found.
Verified locally (port 3200): agents, risk, access, runtime, financebot,
ownership-contract, agent-api-keys, data-sources, shadow-ai, sod,
gateway-enforcement, policy-publish, investigations, emergency-controls,
runtime-gateway, mcp-bridge — 115 tests passed in total across the runs (an earlier run without
`E2E_SLOW_MACHINE` timed out on registration under load and left a blocking
SoD policy in tenant two, which was disabled before the rerun).

### 2026-10-14 — AI tools on MCP servers are discovery candidates

Following the Integration change above, `buildDiscoveryInbox` reads the MCP
inventory through Integration's published `getMcpInventory`. Each tool
classified as an AI agent becomes a "new" candidate (`mcpToolAgentEntry`,
pure). It is keyed `<connection>::<tool name>` like the connection's other
objects, so register / link / ignore record their decision as usual, and a
linked tool leaves the inbox. It is PROBABLE_AGENT, with signals: MCP source,
the AI reason, and "acts, not only reads" for a write tool. The owner is
never guessed. Nothing is registered automatically: a person decides.

Verified: Vitest mcpToolAgents 2/2 (candidate shape; linked, ignored and
stale states); local E2E mcp-inventory 3/3.

## 2026-10-15 — IDENTITY-P0-21: lifecycle triggers for identity rules

The bold lifecycle triggers of the design's §5.2.1 catalogue now start
identity rules, next to created, imported and attribute changed:

- **Triggers:** `identity.activated` (joiner, rehire or leaver cancelled to
  ACTIVE), `identity.moved` (mover), `identity.manager_changed`,
  `identity.leaver`, and `identity.end_date_reached` (a leaver found by the
  end-date sweep, which also fires `identity.leaver`).
- **Mapping** is pure: `lifecycleRuleTriggers(event, origin)` in
  `attributeRules.ts`, unit-tested.
- **Where they fire:** at the end of `recordLifecycleEvents`, the one place
  every lifecycle event is recorded (source imports, manual transitions,
  "disable all access", the end-date sweep). This runs after the change
  itself. `applyIdentityRules` does the work (published rules only, its run
  log, sources win, optimistic write). A rule failure is logged and never
  undoes the event.
- **Editor:** the trigger list comes from `TRIGGER_LABEL`, so the form and
  the pages name the new triggers. Validation accepts them;
  `triggerAttribute` stays only for "attribute changed".

**Verified.**
- typecheck and eslint pass.
- Vitest `modules/agent-identity`: 104/104, including the trigger mapping.
- Local E2E `identity-rules.spec.ts` + `human-lifecycle.spec.ts`: 23/23,
  including setup. A new test publishes an enforced "a person leaves" rule
  under four-eyes. It then marks a matching person LEAVE_PENDING and checks
  that the attribute is set and the run log records "applied".

**Left out.**
- Effects beyond setting an attribute: add to a group, open a task, assign a
  package. These are the rest of IDENTITY-P0-21.
- Manual edits of department or manager on the identity page record no
  mover or manager-change lifecycle event today, so these triggers fire only
  where such an event is recorded (source imports and lifecycle actions).
  The attribute-changed trigger still covers manual edits.

## 2026-10-15 — IDENTITY-P0-21: the "open a task" effect

An identity rule can now open a task about the identity, for its manager or
for identity administrators. This is the "Work" entry of the design's effect
catalogue, and it grants nothing.

- **Migration `0194_identity_rule_tasks.sql`** (applied to dev):
  - `identity_lifecycle_tasks` gains `rule_id` (tenant-composite foreign key
    to `lifecycle_rules`; rules are retired, never deleted) and
    `rule_version`, and the type `rule_task`;
  - `event_id` becomes optional, but only a rule task may leave it empty and
    a rule task must name its rule (check constraint);
  - one open task per rule per identity (a unique partial index).
- **Rules** (`shapeRuleInput`):
  - `open_task` takes `assignee` (`manager` or `identity_admins`) and
    `title` (3 to 200 characters, fixed text or a template);
  - other effects (group, package) are still refused;
  - the service's settable-attribute check now applies only to
    `set_attribute`.
- **Running** (`applyIdentityRules`):
  - after the attribute write, each enforced `open_task` inserts a task with
    the rule and version, assigned to the manager or left for identity
    administrators;
  - an already-open task (23505) is not an error;
  - audited as `identity.rule_task_opened`;
  - report-only rules record what they would do, as before.
- **Task lists** (`listLifecycleTasks`) join the lifecycle event optionally;
  a rule's task shows its own title and "Identity rule". The editor gains a
  "Then" choice: set an attribute or open a task (for, task).

**Verified.**
- typecheck and eslint pass.
- Vitest `modules/agent-identity`: 105/105, including the new effect shape.
- Local E2E:
  - `identity-rules.spec.ts`: 10/10. A new test publishes an enforced rule
    that opens a task when a Finance person is created. It checks for exactly
    one open `rule_task` with the rule, no event, no assignee and the title,
    and that the title shows on the lifecycle tasks page;
  - `human-lifecycle.spec.ts` + `lifecycle-expiry-disable.spec.ts`: passed in
    the same run.

**Left out:** "add to a group" and "assign a package". Both grant access
(groups carry WonderID roles), so they wait for the owner's decision on that
automation path.

## 2026-10-16 — Add user from an identity in a large organization

`listPeopleWithoutAccess(tenantId, includeId)` reads the person a
`/settings/users/new?identity=` link names by id, next to the first 500
by name.
- **Before:** in an organization with more than 500 people, the form opened
  empty for anyone past the first 500 by name.
- **How it reads:** the same filters (tenant, HUMAN, active, has an email,
  not already a member) and the same RLS client. A malformed id is ignored.
- **Found by:** the nightly E2E, `users.spec.ts:211`.
- **Verified:** typecheck and eslint are clean; `next build` passed; local
  E2E `users.spec.ts`: 16 of 16 passed, including the failing test.

## 2026-10-17 — IDENTITY-P0-21 done: rules that add to a group or assign a package

**Owner decision (17 Oct):** each grant is configurable: a person approves it,
or it applies automatically. Every rule is published under four-eyes, which
is the approved automation path for the automatic case (NN #15, design
§5.2.1).

**Built:**
- **Effects.** `add_to_group { group, approval }` and
  `assign_package { package, approval }`, where approval is `required` or
  `automatic` (runtime catalogue and `shapeRuleInput`). Extra parameters are
  dropped. The target must be a group or package of this organization,
  checked when the rule is saved.
- **Running.** After the attribute write, each enforced grant either
  applies (`grantByRule`) or opens a `rule_grant` task (migration 0197),
  one per rule per identity, holding the target's name.
  - Groups go through `addGroupMemberByRule` (`lib/users/groups.ts`). The
    person needs a sign-in; otherwise the run log says "group skipped".
  - Packages go through `assignPackageByRule` (Access): active and
    eligible, with source `rule`, provisioned like any assignment.
  - Both are audited as the system, or as the approver.
- **Approval.** Closing a `rule_grant` task as done makes the grant;
  rejecting it needs a reason. `ruleGrantRefusal`:
  - a group needs `groups.manage_members` plus role assignment;
  - a package needs `access.manage`;
  - nobody approves their own.
  A grant that cannot be made says why (for example `PACKAGE_NOT_ACTIVE`),
  and the task stays open.
- **Simulation** lists each grant as "Group X" or "Package X": "asks a
  person to approve" or "granted".
- **UI:**
  - the rule form offers "Add to a group" and "Assign an access package",
    with "A person approves each one" or "Automatic";
  - the rule page and list show it;
  - lifecycle tasks show "Approve adding to the group "X"", with
    Approve / Reject.

**Verified:**
- Migration 0197 applied to the dev project.
- Unit tests in `modules/agent-identity`, `modules/operations/rules`,
  `modules/access-governance` and `lib/users`: 497/497. New tests:
  - grant parsing (id and approval required, extra parameters dropped);
  - `ruleGrantRefusal`: permissions and no self-approval.

  Two older assertions were updated to the new contract: package grants
  are now allowed, and the catalogue has an approval parameter.
- `identity-rules.spec.ts` gains three E2E tests: target validation; an
  approval task with an impossible grant refused truthfully, then rejected
  with a reason; an automatic group grant skipped for a person with no
  sign-in. They run in the nightly; this container has no local E2E
  environment.
- Typecheck clean except for screenshots missing from this checkout;
  eslint clean.

**Left out:**
- `remove_from_group` and `remove_package` effects.
- A request through the package's own approval chain; the approval task is
  decided by an access or group administrator instead.

## 2026-10-17 — IDENTITY-P0-23: merging two records of the same person

Owner decision 2026-10-17: "go ahead, write it and deploy it" (the
migration). Saviynt reference study D-6.

**Built:**
- **Migration 0198**, applied to the dev project:
  - `identities.merged_into_identity_id`, a same-tenant composite FK that
    can't point at itself;
  - `identity_merges`: tenant_id, RLS, select-only policy for members, no
    write policy. It holds the survivor's values before, the merged
    record's status and sign-in, and every moved row id per
    `table.column`;
  - `merge_identities()` and `unmerge_identities()`: security invoker,
    execute revoked from public, anon and authenticated, granted to
    `service_role` only.
- **What the merge does**, in one transaction:
  - checks that both records are the same kind of person (HUMAN or
    EXTERNAL), in the tenant, and not merged;
  - refuses two sign-ins, the same identity source, the same live
    package, or the same pending request;
  - copies the chosen attributes with their provenance;
  - ends relationships that would duplicate or self-link;
  - moves the current-state references (`identity_merge_moves()`):
    - accounts, ledger, live packages, pending requests and open findings;
    - current relationships, reports, owner and sponsor;
    - application, entitlement and package owners;
    - open task assignees and fulfilment assignees;
    - source records;
  - moves the sign-in when only the merged record has one;
  - sets the merged record inactive.
  
  History stays with the record it happened to: decided requests,
  certification items, source changes, lifecycle events and audit.
- **Undo** restores exactly the recorded rows, the attributes and their
  provenance, and the sign-in. It needs a reason and runs once.
- **Code:**
  - `modules/agent-identity/identityMerge.ts`, pure: `MERGE_FIELDS`,
    `mergeDifferences`, `chosenColumns` (a blank on the survivor takes the
    other value), `mergeRefusal`, `duplicateReason`;
  - `identityMergeService.ts`: `findDuplicatesOf` (same email or name,
    LIKE-escaped, no `or()` interpolation), `getMergePreview` (counts of
    what moves), `mergeIdentities`, `listActiveMergesFor` and
    `undoIdentityMerge`.
  
  Merges and undos are audited as `identity.merged` and
  `identity.merge_undone`, with the reason as typed text, and failures
  are audited too.
- **UI:**
  - the person's page shows "Possible duplicate: … · Compare and merge",
    or "Merge with another record";
  - `/identities/<n>/merge` (needs identity.manage) lists duplicates and
    searches. Compare shows the differing attributes side by side with a
    radio each and a summary of what moves; Merge records asks for
    confirmation;
  - both records show "Merged from/into …" with **Undo the merge**.
- **Docs:** the help guide (identities section, What's new), the
  knowledge base and the ownership map.

**Verified:**
- `tests/identity/identity-merge.sql` against dev: 15 of 15 as expected.
  It covers:
  - the merge and its effects;
  - another organization's record: P0002;
  - a member reads the merge, another organization's member does not;
  - a member running the function or writing a record: 42501;
  - undo restores everything;
  - undo twice and two sign-ins are both refused.
- Supabase security advisors: nothing new.
- Unit tests:
  - `identityMerge.test.ts`, 6 new tests, including that `MERGE_FIELDS`
    matches the migration's list;
  - the full unit suite: 1854 passed.
- `tests/e2e/identity-merge.spec.ts`: suggest, compare, merge, undo; a
  read-only member gets no merge; another organization gets "not found".
  Run on Vercel before the merge (§17.8), three times:
  - first run: the merge worked, but the undo disclosure and its button
    shared a label (test selector), so the button became "Confirm undo";
  - second run: the undo message unmounted with its banner, so undo now
    redirects to the record with the result;
  - third run: 15/15 with `global-configuration.spec.ts`, after
    `identities.spec.ts` and `compliance.spec.ts` had passed in the
    second.
- Typecheck and eslint clean.

**Left out:**
- An organization-wide duplicates list. Detection is per person, on
  their page.
- Merging machine identities and AI agents (agents keep IDENTITY-P0-04's
  merge).

## 2026-10-18 — WID-H11: no self-merge, a reason when records don't match

The hourly audit's register raised WID-H11 on 17 Oct: one administrator
could merge any two people's records, their own included. Owner decision
(18 Oct): no second approver; the four-eyes gap is accepted.

**Built:**
- `mergeActorRefusal` (`identityMerge.ts`): a merge in which either record
  is the actor's own identity is refused, 403 `SELF_DECISION`; two records
  sharing no email and no name need a reason (400). The service audits the
  refusal (`identity.merged`, failure).
- Migration 0202: the 0198 function is renamed `merge_identities_unchecked`
  and is executable by no API role; the new `merge_identities` (same
  signature, `SECURITY DEFINER`, service role only) checks both rules
  (42501, 22023) and then calls it.
- The merge page shows the self-merge refusal instead of the form; the
  reason field is required when the records don't match.

**Verified:** `identityMerge.test.ts` (WID-H11, 2 cases) with `lib/rbac`
and `getTenantContext.test.ts`: 10 files, 64 passed. Live
`tests/identity/identity-merge-checks.sql` against the dev project: 8/8.
Migration applied to the dev project; security advisors show no new item.
`npm run typecheck` and eslint on the changed files clean.

**Left out:** re-running SoD and eligibility for the survivor, and flagging
merged-in access for the next review (the register's suggested actions,
not its closure criteria). Merged-in rows are already listed in
`identity_merges.moved`.

## 2026-10-18 — Identity attributes in configuration bundles (for PLATFORM-P0-13)

Platform's configuration bundle now carries identity attributes; the
Identity module owns how they are planned and applied
(`attributeBundle.ts`, pure; `attributeBundleService.ts`), published from
`service.ts` (`listBundleAttributes`, `planBundleAttributes`,
`applyAttributePlan`, `attributePlanSize`). Import adds missing
definitions and restores or retires them to the file's state through
`createAttributeDefinition` / `setAttributeDefinitionActive`, so each
change is validated and audited as from the Identity Attributes page; a
definition that differs is never edited. Tests: `attributeBundle.test.ts`
(4). Details in the Platform audit log.

## 2026-10-20 — Lifecycle events start event-based access reviews (COMPLIANCE-P0-15)

`opensEventReview()` (pure, tested) marks a working person's mover,
manager change, conversion or rehire event; the lifecycle service then
calls Compliance's `launchCampaignsForLifecycleEvent()` (loaded at call
time, never throws), after the event, its tasks and birthright work.
Nothing else in the lifecycle flow changed.

## 2026-10-21 — An identity's Audit history tab (owner feedback)

Owner's test feedback: "Add audit history tab here, it should capture every
change that happens to this identity".

**Changed:**
- The identity page's Activity tab is now **Audit history**. It covers the
  identity, its user and agent (as before), plus its accounts and the access
  requests for it (`identityRelatedObjectIds()`, Access module: two indexed
  reads, at most 100 each), up to the latest 100 events.
- Each line is in plain words (`describeAuditEvent()`,
  `app/(customer)/identities/history.ts`): a title per action, the fields
  that changed or a status from and to, who did it (a name, "a connection" or
  WonderID) and the time in UTC. Actor names come from
  `listObjectHistory()` (Operations), which reads the events as the user
  under RLS and the tenant filter, then looks up only those actors' names.
- The chain (related ids, then events) runs alongside the page's other
  reads, so the page gains no sequential wave.

**Deliberately not done:** values are not recorded. `updateIdentity()`
audits field names only (personal data stays out of the append-only,
hash-chained audit log: §17.7, §18.3.3, erasure never touches it); the
history says which fields changed.

**Verified:** `history.test.ts` (4 passed); typecheck (only the
pre-existing image-module errors of a checkout without `next-env.d.ts`);
eslint on the changed files; `identities.spec.ts` updated to the tab's new
name, run in tonight's nightly (owner instruction: E2E only at night).

## 2026-10-21 — Audit history is the identity page's last tab (owner feedback)

Moved after Edit. No other change.
