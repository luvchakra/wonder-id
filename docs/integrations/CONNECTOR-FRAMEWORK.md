# The WonderID connector framework

How WonderID reads identities and access from an organization's systems, and
how to write a connector for a system WonderID does not support yet.

Code: `modules/integrations/framework`. Built-in connectors:
`modules/integrations/framework/definitions`. Storage of organizations' own
connectors: `connector_definitions` (migration 0108).

## The rule (non-negotiable #20)

There is no direct connection between WonderID and an organization's data.
Every flow goes through this framework:

- **Outbound.** Only the framework's drivers call an organization's systems.
- **Inbound.** Only a connection's receivers accept data from them, at
  `/api/connect/v1/<connection id>/…`. This includes the Runtime Gateway.
- **Files.** A CSV is read by a connector (the `file` driver), whether it
  is fetched on a schedule, sent to a connection, or imported from an
  object page (see "Files, schedules and imports").

Product modules read only what the framework stored.
`tests/architecture/connector-boundary.test.ts` scans the source and fails
when any other module calls out or opens a machine route. Widening its
allowlists needs the user's approval.

An organization's own mail server is one of its systems too. The `smtp`
driver (`framework/drivers/smtp.ts`, owner request 2026-10-20, test
feedback item 14) sends the organization's e-mail through it, TLS only and
behind the same address guard as the LDAP and SQL drivers. Operations'
e-mail channel calls it through the module's published service; no
allowlist was widened.

## The Connector Gateway

User requirement (2026-10-10): "all such connections should pass through one
gateway which sits between WonderID and external world". The user also
explicitly approved adding the gateway to the outbound allowlist of
`tests/architecture/connector-boundary.test.ts` (2026-10-10, as non-negotiable
#20 requires for any widening). Code:
`modules/integrations/gateway` (`gateway.ts`, with its pure rules in
`gatewayRules.ts`).

```text
WonderID ── sync, test, MCP discovery, preview ──▶ ┌─────────────────────┐ ──▶ organization's systems
                                                   │  Connector Gateway  │
WonderID ◀── /api/connect receivers ────────────── │  policies + ledger  │ ◀── organization's systems
                                                   └─────────────────────┘
```

- **One place.** The http, mcp, ldap and sql drivers are built only inside
  the gateway. A connector gets its drivers from a gateway session
  (`createDefinitionConnector(gateway)`), and every receiver request passes a
  session too (`receive.ts`). `connector-boundary.test.ts` fails if a driver
  is built anywhere else, or if a receiver stops going through it.
- **A session is one run**: a sync, a connection test, a credential check,
  an MCP discovery, a preview, or one received request. The caller opens it
  with the connection row (`openGateway({ tenantId, integrationId, status })`)
  and calls `flush()` in a `finally`.
- **Policies, in this order, for every outbound request:**
  1. the connection is not disabled (a disabled connection also receives
     nothing);
  2. the run's request budget is not spent (10,000 requests across every
     driver);
  3. the definition's `rateLimitPerSecond` (default 10) is honoured, as a
     token bucket. This used to live in the http driver alone; it now
     covers MCP, LDAP and SQL too.
  4. HTTP and MCP then go through `guardedFetch` (SSRF guard, redirects,
     20 s timeout, 10 MB response cap). LDAP and the databases connect only
     to an address `resolveSafeHost` vetted, with their own timeouts and
     row limits.
- **Traffic ledger** (`connector_traffic`, migration 0110). Each request is
  counted in memory per session: direction, operation (`http GET`,
  `mcp tools/list`, `ldap search`, `sql query`, `receive events`), host,
  outcome (`ok`, `error`, `blocked`), error category, bytes in and out, and
  duration. `flush()` writes once per session through
  `record_connector_traffic()`, which adds to the minute's row, so a busy
  connection produces at most one row per minute per kind of traffic.
  - Only the host name is recorded: never a path, query string, header,
    body, error message or credential. For inbound traffic the sender's
    address is not recorded at all.
  - Receivers record an authentication failure as `blocked`
    (`unauthenticated`), and a disabled connection as `blocked`
    (`disabled`). A request for a connection that does not exist is not
    recorded: there is no organization to account it to.
  - A preview of an unsaved definition is recorded under the organization
    with no connection ("Connector previews").
  - A failure to record is logged and never fails the run: the traffic
    already happened.
  - Members of the organization read it; only the service role writes it.
    Rows older than 30 days are purged by the daily retention cron
    (`/api/cron/privacy` calls `purge_connector_traffic()`).
- **Where to see it:** **Integrations → Gateway** (`/integrations/gateway`)
  shows the last 24 hours per connection, and each integration's page has a
  "Traffic (24h)" card.
- **Adding a driver** (for example a file driver): build it inside
  `gateway.ts` with `meteredDriver("<kind>", factory)` and add it to the
  session's `drivers`. Nothing else may construct it.

## The idea

A connector is a **definition**: JSON that describes one product's API. It
says which settings an organization enters, how to authenticate, which
requests return which records, and how each record maps onto WonderID's
canonical objects. One engine runs every definition, so supporting a new
product takes a definition, not new code.

- **Generic per product.** The `keycloak` connector works for any Keycloak.
  Each organization enters its own address, realm and credentials.
- **One connector per system.** HR, the identity provider, the directory and
  each application each get their own connection, so each keeps its own
  credentials, schedule and sync history.
- **Read only unless turned on.** The framework imports. A definition may
  declare writes (`write`, see "Changes in the system"), but a connection
  makes them only after an administrator turns writes on for it, and only
  for approved requests (non-negotiable #12, decision D3).
- **Not code.** Mappings use field paths, string templates and a fixed list
  of transforms. Anything that would need code belongs in a driver, which
  WonderID owns and reviews.

## The Generic REST API type

Fix-list item 19 (owner request, 2026-10-20). The built-in `rest-api` type
(`definitions/rest-api.ts`) connects any REST/JSON API without writing a
definition: the connection's own settings say how to sign in, which request
returns each kind of record and how its fields map. `restApi.ts`
(`expandDefinition`) turns those settings into an ordinary definition every
time the connection is parsed (`parseConnectorConfig`), when it is created
and when its settings are saved. The result goes through
`validateDefinition`, so it meets every rule a built-in meets (relative
paths only, no secret outside the auth block, writes that name their
target, safe patterns), and runs through the same engine, gateway and
limits. Only a connection made from the built-in is expanded; a custom
definition that reuses the key runs as written.

- **Sign-in method:** none, Basic, bearer, API key in a header or the query
  string (`apiKeyName`), OAuth 2.0 client credentials (secret in the body or
  HTTP Basic; `tokenUrl` is a url setting, so it is an allowed origin). The
  built definition asks only for the secrets that method uses.
- **Paging** applies to every read: page number (`firstPage`), offset,
  cursor (`cursorPath`) or Link header. `pagination: none` in a kind's box
  turns it off for that request. **Extra headers** go on every request.
- **One box per kind** (`identities`, `accounts`, `entitlements`, `access`,
  `applications`): the request line (`[METHOD] /path[?query] [JSON body]`),
  then `records:`, `for each:`, `unwind:`, `total:`, `where:` and
  `pagination:` lines, then `field = source | transform | …` lines. A source
  is a path (`a, b` tries each), a template (`{record.first} {record.last}`),
  a quoted constant, or a mapping in the definition's JSON form. Transforms
  are the closed list plus `map:a=b,*=c`, `prefix:`, `contains:`,
  `replace:old=>new`, `regex:` and `default:`.
- **Changes it can make:** `operation [(repeatable)] = METHOD /path [JSON]`
  per line, for `revoke_access`, `disable_account`, `grant_access` and
  `create_account`; off until an administrator turns writes on.
- Every mistake is reported against the setting and line it is on.

`contract.test.ts` runs the full http contract against a sample
configuration (an API key header, numbered pages, access per group, all four
changes). Database, PowerShell and Active Directory connectors from the same
fix-list item are separate pieces of work.

## Connection types and connections

Integrations has two levels (user decision, 2026-10-10):

- A **connection type** is a definition: one kind of system and its
  protocol. **Integrations → Connection Types** (`/integrations/types`) lists
  the built-in types and your organization's, grouped by category, with the
  protocol, what each reads and receives, and its version. A type's page
  (`/integrations/types/{builtin|custom}/{key}`) shows the protocol details:
  driver (HTTP REST, MCP Streamable HTTP, LDAP, SQL, or receive only),
  authentication method and the fields it asks for (never their values),
  settings, pagination, rate limit, what it receives (each channel's path
  under `/api/connect/v1/<connection>/` and how the sender authenticates),
  origin, vendor and API reference. Its one action is **Create connection**.
- A **connection** is one of your organization's systems, connected with a
  type: its own settings, encrypted credentials, schedule and sync history.
  **Integrations → Connections** (`/integrations`) lists them with the type
  each was created from. **New connection** starts from the types list.

`describeConnectionType()` in `typeSummary.ts` derives the protocol details
from a definition, so the screens and the catalog summary say the same
thing; the receiving side comes from the definition's `receive`. The old `/integrations/connectors` pages redirect to the
new ones; the API paths below are unchanged.

## Using a connector

1. Go to **Integrations → Connection Types**, open the product's type and
   select **Create connection**
   (`/integrations/types/{origin}/{key}/connect`).
2. Enter a name, the settings and the credentials, then select **Connect**.
   - WonderID tests the credentials before storing them, and encrypts them
     (AES-256-GCM).
   - If the test fails, the integration is saved without credentials and
     the page says so.
3. On the integration's page, select **Run sync now**, or set a schedule
   (see "Files, schedules and imports").
4. For an HR connector, create an **identity source** with the source type
   "Integration" and choose the connection. The suggested mappings already
   read every canonical field (`normalized.*`).

An integration keeps a snapshot of the definition it was created with. A new
version of a definition never changes a running connection without its
owner's action.

Each one is verified against a real system by
`modules/integrations/framework/live.test.ts` (see "Certifying a connector").

### Databases

The `sql` driver speaks four protocols, chosen by the address's scheme
(`modules/integrations/framework/sqlDialects.ts`):

| Scheme | Database | Library | Read-only session | Row limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres://`, `postgresql://` | PostgreSQL (and compatible services) | `pg` | `BEGIN READ ONLY` … `ROLLBACK` | `LIMIT n` around the statement |
| `sqlserver://`, `mssql://` | Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL | `tedious` | read-only application intent, in a transaction that is always rolled back (T-SQL has no read-only transaction) | `SET ROWCOUNT n` |
| `oracle://host:2484/service` | Oracle Database (TCPS listener) | `oracledb` (thin mode, no client install) | `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` … rollback | `ROWNUM <= n` around the statement |
| `mysql://`, `mariadb://` | MySQL, MariaDB | `mysql2` | `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY` … `ROLLBACK` | `LIMIT n` around the statement |

- **Always verified TLS.** The certificate is checked against the host name
  in the address and verification is never turned off. The socket goes to
  the address `resolveSafeHost` vetted (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL); the
  Oracle thin driver opens its own socket by host name right after the check.
- **Timeouts.** Connect 10 s; each statement 30 s, or `timeoutSeconds`
  (5–120) where a definition offers it.
- **Column names.** Oracle's are lower-cased (it folds unquoted names to
  upper case), so a mapping reads the same names on every database.
- **Your own statements.** A resource whose `query` is exactly
  `{settings.<key>}` runs the statement the organization entered in that
  text setting. `validateSettings()` holds it to the definition rules when
  the connection is saved, and the driver checks it again before each run.
  An empty setting reads nothing. `sql-database` works this way: each
  statement returns fixed column names (listed in each setting's help).
- **`sqlDialects`** on a definition names the databases its queries are
  written for; the address must be one of them.
- **Oracle and a private CA.** The thin driver takes a CA only inside a PEM
  wallet (`ewallet.pem`: a key, its certificate and the CA), so it is an
  optional `wallet` secret (with `walletPassword`), declared in `auth`.
- **Not supported: Sybase (SAP ASE) and IBM Db2.** Their protocols (TDS 5.0,
  DRDA) have no maintained pure-JavaScript driver; the available ones need
  Java or native client libraries, which the hosting runtime does not have.
  Export to CSV (the `csv-file` connector) in the meantime.
- **Verified live** (2026-10-20) with `live.test.ts` against PostgreSQL 16,
  SQL Server 2022, MySQL 8.4 and Oracle Database Free 23 in containers, each
  behind a private CA. A wrong host name, a missing CA and a wrong password
  were each refused.

## Receiving: how systems send WonderID data

A definition's `receive` section declares what the organization's systems
may send. Each channel is served per connection:

| Channel | Path | Sender proves itself with | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runtimeEvents` | `POST /api/connect/v1/<id>/events` | the connection's receiving secret, as `Authorization: Bearer …` or an HMAC-SHA256 (hex) of the raw body | Each event is mapped by the definition, validated, kept as the connection's `activity` evidence, and recorded by Runtime as DID. An unknown or ambiguous agent is quarantined (Shadow AI), never recorded. One event, or a list of up to 500. |
| `webhook` | `POST /api/connect/v1/<id>/webhook` | the receiving secret (bearer or HMAC) | The event is kept as an `activity` record; a redelivery with the same id is stored once. |
| `gateway` | `POST /api/connect/v1/<id>/gateway/authorize` and `…/gateway/tools/filter` | the agent's own API key, which must belong to the connection's organization | Runtime's decision (or tool filter) for that agent. |
| `file` | `POST /api/connect/v1/<id>/file`, the CSV as the body, header `x-wonderid-kind` (and optionally `x-wonderid-filename`) | the receiving secret (bearer or HMAC) | The file is checked, stored (`connector_files`) and read by the sync it starts. See "Files, schedules and imports". |
| `scim` | `GET/POST /api/connect/v1/<id>/scim/v2/Users`, `GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE …/scim/v2/Users/<id>`, `GET …/scim/v2/ServiceProviderConfig` | the receiving secret, as `Authorization: Bearer …` | Users pushed over SCIM 2.0 (RFC 7644). Each is kept as an `identity` of the connection in `integration_objects`, mapped by `receive.scim.fields` (the enterprise extension is also readable as `enterprise.*`). The id is WonderID's (`normalized.externalId`). The identity sources reading the connection then run, one at a time per source (`runSourcesAfterPush`, migration 0136). DELETE marks the user missing at the source. Filters: `userName eq` and `externalId eq` only; PATCH paths without filters only. Answers are SCIM JSON (`application/scim+json`). The built-in is `scim-inbound` (INTEGRATION-P0-22). |

The rules every receiver follows:

- **Organization.** The organization is always the connection's own; nothing
  in a request can choose it, the connection or the event's source.
- **Disabled connections.** A connection that is disabled or deleted receives
  nothing.
- **Order of checks.** The sender is authenticated before the body is even
  parsed, so an unauthenticated sender learns nothing about the expected
  shape. Bodies are capped (1 MB for events and webhooks, 10 MB for a file,
  16 KB for the gateway, 256 KB for SCIM). Only SCIM takes methods other
  than POST.
- **The receiving secret.** WonderID issues it from the connection's page
  ("Issue secret") or `POST /api/v1/integrations/<id>/receiver-secret`. It is
  shown once and kept only encrypted. Replacing it stops the old one at once.

A runtime event maps to: `eventTime`, `action` and `success` (required);
`externalId` (makes redelivery a duplicate); `agentIdentityRef` (the agent's
WonderID id, or a reference an identity of it is linked under); `tool`,
`application`, `resource`, `dataClassification`, `eventType`, `sessionId`,
`correlationId` and `mcpServer`. WonderID's own format uses these names
directly (`definitions/runtime-event-fields.ts`).

## Files, schedules and imports

CSV is a connector type: the `file` driver. Every way a file reaches
WonderID ends in the same place, a file connection's sync, which maps the
rows with the definition and stores them in `integration_objects` like any
other connector.

### The file driver

- **One file per kind.** Each resource reads one CSV. Its `file.url` names a
  url setting holding the HTTPS address; when that is empty, the resource
  reads the newest file the connection received for its kind.
- **From an address.** Fetched through the Connector Gateway like the http
  driver (its policies and accounting, the SSRF guard), with the
  definition's auth (`none`, `bearer`, `basic` or
  `header`), a 20 s timeout and a 10 MB cap. Testing the connection reads
  each address and checks its columns.
- **Received files.** A sync reads the newest unread file per kind and marks
  it, and any older unread file of that kind, as read when the run ends. A
  newer file supersedes an older one that was never read.
- **The format.** RFC 4180: quoted fields with separators, line breaks and
  doubled quotes; CRLF, LF or CR; a byte-order mark. The first row names the
  columns. A file that has an unterminated quote, text after a closing
  quote, a row with a different number of fields, an unnamed or duplicate
  column, or more than 50,000 rows is refused whole, with the row.
- **Columns.** A record's keys are the column names, matched in any case and
  ignoring spaces, `_` and `-`: "Work Email" is read by the path
  `workemail`. A mapping usually lists alternatives
  (`{ "path": ["externalid", "id", "employeeid"] }`). `file.columns` names a
  string setting of renames, `identity.email = Work Email; account.username =
  Login`, so one connection can read its own headers without a new
  definition. Empty cells are left out, so a mapping's `default` applies.
  Columns no mapping reads are ignored (kept in the record's `raw`), so a
  WonderID export, which uses the canonical field names, imports back.
- **Before storing.** A received or imported file is checked first: its
  structure, then that the columns can fill every required field of the
  kind. A row that still cannot be mapped (an empty id) is reported on the
  sync job with its row number.

`csv-file` is the generic definition: five optional addresses (identities,
accounts, entitlements, access, applications), an application name for
accounts and entitlements without one, the column renames, an optional
Bearer token for the addresses, and the `file` receiver. By default each
column is read as the canonical field of the same name; an access row needs
`accountExternalId` and `entitlementExternalId` (its id is the two joined).

### Schedules

A connection's `schedule` (`integrations.schedule`) is `manual` (the
default), `daily` or `hourly`, set on every connection that reads, on its
page (the Sync jobs card) or with `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/integrations/<id>/schedule`
(`{ "schedule": "daily" }`; reading needs `integration.read`, changing it
`integration.update`; audited as `integration.schedule_changed`). `GET /api/cron/connector-syncs` (Vercel Cron, bearer
`CRON_SECRET`) runs every due connection as an ordinary sync job of trigger
`scheduled`, for the connection's own tenant, audited as the system
(`integration.scheduled_sync_started`, then `integration.sync_completed`).
Each run is idempotent per connection and window (`d:2026-10-10` or
`h:2026-10-10T05`): a unique index refuses a second job for the same window.

The current Vercel plan allows daily crons only, so the cron runs once a day
(20:45 UTC). A daily connection runs once per day; an hourly one runs at
every cron run, which today is also daily. `hourly` is kept as chosen and
takes effect when the cron runs more often. A run that does not start within
the cron's time budget waits for the next run.

The same cron keeps each connection's newest five received files and
deletes older files a sync has read. An unread file is never deleted.

### Importing from an object page

**Members (FOUNDATION-P0-32, 2026-10-11).** The Users page imports
`member` records: people to invite, identified by e-mail (columns `email`,
`displayName`, `roles` comma-separated, optional `accountType`,
`authMethod`). The `csv-file` definition reads them only from an upload (no
address setting, so never on a schedule). Foundation applies them as
invitations (`lib/users/users.ts`, `planMemberInvitations` and
`applyMemberInvitations`). Each row is new (invited), already a member (left
as is, so the same file again invites nobody) or invalid with the reason.
Roles need role management, and only roles whose permissions the importer
holds can be given. Staged `member` objects and stored files are allowed by
migration 0125.

User decision (2026-10-10): an import from an object page is **previewed
first** and **additive**. The rows go straight into that page's list: new
records are added and existing ones updated. A record missing from the file
is never removed, revoked or deactivated (there are no leavers here).

Two calls, both `multipart/form-data` with the same fields, both needing a
session with `integration.execute` (the permission that runs a sync) **and**
the page's manage permission (`identity.manage` for identities,
`users.invite` for members, `access.manage` for the rest):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `identity`, `account`, `entitlement`, `access_grant`, `application` or `member` |
| `file` | the CSV, at most 10 MB and 5,000 rows |
| `scope` | the page (`people`, `external-identities`, `machine-identities`, `identities`): the type new identities get when the file has no `identityType` column |

1. **`POST /api/v1/imports/preview`** reads and maps the file with the File
   imports connection's definition and settings (exactly as its sync will)
   and matches each record against the page's records. Nothing is stored or
   changed. `200 { data: { kind, rows, counts: { new, update, unchanged,
   invalid, review }, columns, shown: [{ row, externalId, decision, values,
   changes: [{ field, from, to }], note }] } }`. At most 500 rows are sent
   (rows that will not be imported first); the counts cover the whole file.
2. **`POST /api/v1/imports`** (after the person clicks **Confirm import**).
   The file becomes an upload of the organization's single **File imports**
   connection (`csv-file`, created on first use, `config.purpose =
   "file_imports"`), whose sync reads, maps and stores it in
   `integration_objects`. What that sync stored (its `sync_job_id`) is then
   handed to the module that owns the records, which re-plans it against
   the current data and writes it. `200 { data: { jobId, integrationId,
   rows, counts: { created, updated, unchanged, skipped, failed }, problems:
   [{ row, externalId, message }] } }`.

Errors: `400 INVALID_FILE` with `details: [{ row, column?, message }]` (row 1
is the header; nothing was stored); `409` when the File imports connection
is disabled or reads that kind from an address; `502 SYNC_FAILED` when the
connection could not read the file (nothing was added).

The whole file is refused when a record appears twice (the sync would keep
only the last), when an account or entitlement file has no `application`
column (and the connection names no application), or above 5,000 rows.

**How each record is matched and written:**

| Kind | Matched by | Written by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| identity | WonderID id, then source reference (`source_native_id`), then email, then username; several matches → **needs review** | Integration plans; Identity's `applySourcedIdentities` writes (precedence 1000, the lowest: a source of record such as HR keeps the fields it owns) | An empty cell changes nothing. New identities keep the external id as their source reference. Managers are set after every record has an identity. |
| application | WonderID id, then name | Access's `registerApplication` / `updateApplication` | A rename only when the row names the application by its id. |
| entitlement | WonderID id, then application + name | Access (`fileImport.ts`), batched | The application must already exist. |
| account | WonderID id, then application + external id | Access (`fileImport.ts`), batched | `owner` links an unlinked account to an identity; an account already linked keeps its owner. |
| access_grant | account + entitlement | Access's `createManualAccessGrant` | The same rules as access granted by hand (an AI agent's account, separation of duties). Existing access is left as it is. |

The service functions are `previewFileForObject(ctx, kind, scope, csvText)`
and `importFileForObject(ctx, kind, scope, filename, csvText)` in
`modules/integrations/service.ts`; the pure rules are
`modules/integrations/fileImportPlan.ts` and
`modules/access-governance/fileImportRules.ts`. Audit: every import
(`integration.file_imported`, with kind, row count, size and SHA-256) and
its outcome (`integration.file_applied`, with the counts), plus the owning
module's own events (`identity.created`/`identity.updated`,
`application.registered`/`application.updated`, `entitlement.imported`,
`account.imported`, `access.grant_created`). Never the rows' values.

In the app, the object page's **Actions → Import CSV…** dialog shows the
preview as a table in the page's own columns, with each row's result
(**New**, **Update** with old → new values, **No change**, **Needs review**,
**Not imported** with the reason), and **Confirm import** or **Cancel
import**. After the import it says what was added and updated, lists rows
not imported, and refreshes the page's list.

**Platform limit.** Vercel accepts request bodies up to 4.5 MB, so a file
sent or imported through the hosted app is limited to that; a file fetched
from an address can be 10 MB.

## After a sync (INTEGRATION-P0-19)

A full sync does not stop at staging. When its import ends, the same job
carries the data on, in order:

1. **Identities.** Each active identity source that reads the connection
   (template "integration") runs a full reconciliation from the
   connection's staged identities: create, update, link, leavers under the
   source's own guard.
2. **Accounts.** Each application whose live onboarding configuration names
   the connection reconciles its accounts (Access,
   `reconcileApplicationAccountsAsSystem`).
3. **Entitlements and access** (ACCESS-P0-27). For each of those applications
   whose entitlements come from the connector, its entitlements (matched by
   the connection's id for them) and who holds which (account by the
   identifier field, entitlement by the connection's id). What the
   connection no longer lists is marked missing from the source, never
   revoked; listed again, it is restored. The same reconciliation can be
   previewed and applied on the application's page.

The job records each step in `pipeline` (status, its run record, counts,
and the reason it failed or was skipped) and the chain in
`pipeline_status` (`none`, `running`, `succeeded`, `partial`, `failed`). A
failed step skips the steps after it, and the chain is then failed and the
organization notified ("Update after sync failed"). A failed import skips
the whole chain. A partial run, such as an object-page import, has no
chain. The connection page shows the newest job's steps and refreshes while
one runs. "Run sync now" runs the same chain in the background. Audit:
`integration.pipeline_completed`.

A connection runs as often as the most frequent of its own schedule and the
schedules of the active identity sources reading it, so setting a source to
daily syncs its connection daily, and the source runs after it.

## Removed at the source (INTEGRATION-P0-18)

A sync only ever adds and updates staged objects; it never deletes one. When
an object disappears from the source, a run says so by setting the staged
object's `missing_at_source_at`, carefully:

- **Only a complete full run marks.** A run is `full` (the default: a
  connection reads everything it holds), `incremental` or `partial`. For
  each kind, a full run marks only when that kind was read completely: the
  read did not fail, did not stop at a limit (`maxRecords`, the http
  driver's page limit, the MCP page limit), every record mapped and stored,
  and, for a file connection, a file was actually read. Each driver reports
  that per kind (`FetchReport`: `truncated`, `unread`). A received file is
  taken as the full extract of its kind; an object-page import is
  `partial` and never marks anything.
- **Never what a newer run saw.** An object last seen by a run that started
  after this one is never marked, so overlapping syncs cannot undo each
  other.
- **The mass-missing guard.** When more than the organization's share
  (Global Configuration, Connections, `integration.massMissingPercent`, default
  20%) of a kind's present objects would be marked, and the kind has at
  least 20, nothing is marked: the run is held, the organization is notified
  ("Sync held for review"), and someone with `integration.update` approves
  or discards it on the connection's page
  (`POST /api/v1/integrations/{id}/jobs/{jobId}/missing`). Approving is
  refused once a newer run has started.
- **A missing object comes back** when a later run sees it again.

What each run decided per kind is on the job (`missing_status`,
`missing_summary`) and in its `integration.sync_completed` audit event. The
published readers (`getNormalizedObjects`, `getNormalizedObjectsForTenant` and the identity-source reader)
leave missing objects out by default; the MCP inventory includes them. The
marking itself is `stage_mark_missing()` (migration 0117), service role
only.

## Changes in the system (INTEGRATION-P0-11 / P0-13)

Decision D3 (approved 2026-10-12): writes are per connection, declared,
turned on by the organization and gated by approval. Reversible changes
came first (slice 1); adding access and creating accounts followed
(slice 2, 2026-10-12).

**Declaring writes.** An http or ldap definition may list, under `write`:

| Operation | What it does | Must use |
|---|---|---|
| `revoke_access` | Removes one entitlement from one account (a group membership, a role) | `{target.account}` and `{target.entitlement}` |
| `disable_account` | Disables one account | `{target.account}` |
| `grant_access` | Adds one entitlement to one account | `{target.account}` and `{target.entitlement}` |
| `create_account` | Creates an account for a person or agent | `{target.email}` or `{target.username}` (`{target.displayName}` may also be used) |

Each is one request (`method` POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE; `path`, `query`,
`headers` and `body` strings may use `{settings.…}` and the target). The
target values are the ids the system itself gave the account and the
entitlement, as imported; for a new account, the email, username and
display name of the identity it is for (a value the identity lacks fails
the write with that reason, and the task goes to its owner). The request carries `Idempotency-Key`. Since
WID-H02 (2026-10-12) it is one per task and change, not per attempt: every
attempt at the same change sends the same key, and a changed request (a
corrected definition) sends a new one.

**Repeatable changes** (WID-H02). Add `"repeatable": true` to an http
operation when sending the same change twice cannot make it twice: the
system honours `Idempotency-Key`, or the change sets a state (adding a
member who is already there, setting `enabled` to false). It decides what
happens when the outcome of a change is unclear (a timeout, a dropped
connection, 408 or 5xx):
- **Repeatable:** WonderID sends it again, up to three tries.
- **Not repeatable** (the default): WonderID does not send it again. It
  reads the system (a verification sync). If the change is there,
  reconciliation closes the task. If not, the task's owner may try again,
  but only once that read has finished.

A 429, or a connection that never reached the system, is retried either
way. A 4xx is never retried. LDAP changes are always repeatable: the
directory's "already there" answer counts as done. In `scim-2`, adding,
removing and disabling are repeatable; creating a user is not.

For example:

```json
"write": {
  "revoke_access": { "request": { "method": "DELETE", "path": "/groups/{target.entitlement}/members/{target.account}" } },
  "disable_account": { "repeatable": true, "request": { "method": "PATCH", "path": "/users/{target.account}", "body": { "enabled": false } } },
  "grant_access": { "repeatable": true, "request": { "method": "PUT", "path": "/groups/{target.entitlement}/members/{target.account}" } },
  "create_account": { "request": { "method": "POST", "path": "/users", "body": { "email": "{target.email}", "name": "{target.displayName}" } } }
}
```

Reads still may only GET or POST. Built-in writes so far (INTEGRATION-P0-22):
`scim-2` (all four) and `ldap-directory` 1.1.0 (adding and removing group
members).

**LDAP changes** (ldap driver, INTEGRATION-P0-22). Each operation is
`{ "ldap": { "dn", "modify" } }`, or `{ "ldap": { "dn", "add" } }` for
`create_account`:
- `dn` is exactly `{target.account}` or `{target.entitlement}` (a DN read
  from the directory, used as it is), or a template such as
  `uid={target.username},ou=People,{settings.baseDn}`. Target values filled
  into a template are escaped as DN values (RFC 4514); settings are not.
- `modify` lists 1 to 10 `{ operation: add | delete | replace, attribute,
  values }`.
- `add` is the new entry's attributes, `objectClass` included.

LDAP has no idempotency key. A directory answer that the change is already
there counts as done: adding a value that exists (result 20), deleting one
that is gone (16), adding an entry that exists (68). A retry is then safe.
For example (the built-in directory type):

```json
"write": {
  "grant_access": { "ldap": { "dn": "{target.entitlement}", "modify": [{ "operation": "add", "attribute": "member", "values": ["{target.account}"] }] } },
  "revoke_access": { "ldap": { "dn": "{target.entitlement}", "modify": [{ "operation": "delete", "attribute": "member", "values": ["{target.account}"] }] } }
}
```

**Turning writes on.** A connection whose definition declares writes shows
"Changes in the system" on its page: Off by default. Turning it on (or
`PUT /api/v1/integrations/{id}/writes {"enabled": true}`, `integration.update`)
declares the connection's write capabilities, exactly what its definition
supports; turning it off declares none, and any write is refused at once.
Both are audited (`integration.writes_enabled` / `_disabled`).

**What happens to an approved change.** When a fulfilment task opens
(access to add or remove, an account to create or disable) and a
connection with writes on supports the operation, the connector does it.
The connection is the one the account was imported from (for access, the
entitlement must come from that same connection); for a new account, the
connection the application's live onboarding reconciles against.

1. The task is claimed for the connector; nobody else can act on it while
   it runs.
2. The connector makes the change (`connectorWrites.ts`: idempotency
   record, capability check, the Connector Gateway, audit
   `integration.write_*`). A network failure, 429 or 5xx is retried twice,
   after 2 and 8 seconds.
3. On success the task completes (not yet verified; added access is
   `fulfilled_unverified`) and a sync with trigger `verification` reads the
   system again. Reconciliation closes the task as verified only when the
   change is really there.
4. On failure the task stays open for its owner with the reason, and the
   owner is told. Whoever may work on the task can do it by hand or "Try
   again" (`retry_connector`). A run that never reports back is handed back
   by the daily sweep after 15 minutes, saying its outcome is unknown.

**The mass-change guard (QA-P0-26).** A connection makes at most the
organization's limit of changes in an hour (Global Configuration,
Connections, `integration.maxWritesPerHour`, default 100). Changes made or
in flight in the last hour count; failed and refused ones do not. Past the
limit, a write is refused before anything is sent (`integration.write_blocked`,
with the reason), so its task goes back to its owner, who is told. The owner
can do it by hand, or "Try again" once the hour allows. A run of bad
approvals or a looping rule therefore stops at the limit instead of changing
everything.

**Access for someone with no account yet.** The approved access waits on a
placeholder account. When the connection can both create accounts and add
access, a create-account task opens for the placeholder and the connector
creates the account; the access task waits without notifying its owner.
The verification sync reads the new account, account reconciliation
correlates it to the identity and replaces the placeholder (the
create-account task is verified), and then the connector adds the access
(`resumeConnectorGrants`), verified by the next read. If the create fails,
its owner is told; the access task stays open for them too.

Tasks the connector cannot do (writes off, an operation not supported, an
account or entitlement without a system id, a new account with no
email or username) stay a person's task, as before.

## Writing a connector

Go to **Integrations → Connection Types → Write a connection type**
(`/integrations/types/new`), or start from an existing one ("Use as a
starting point" under "Definition" on its type page).

The page checks the definition as you type, using the same rules the server
applies. **Try it against a system** runs one resource against a real system
without saving anything; that run is audited. **Publish** saves the
version for your organization only and opens its type page.

Versions are immutable. To change a definition, raise `version` and publish
again. Existing connections keep the version they were created with.

The same operations are available over the API (session authentication):

| Method and path | Permission | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/integrations/connectors` | `integration.read` | Lists the catalog: built-in definitions, then your organization's |
| `GET /api/v1/integrations/connectors/{builtin\|custom}/{key}` | `integration.read` | Returns one definition (`?version=`), plus your organization's versions of it |
| `POST /api/v1/integrations/connectors` | `integration.create` | Publishes a definition (the request body) |
| `POST /api/v1/integrations/connectors/preview` | `integration.create` | Runs one resource. Body: `{ manifest, settings, secret, resource, limit? }` |
| `POST /api/v1/integrations/connectors/connect` | `integration.create` | Creates a connection. Body: `{ origin, key, version?, name, settings, secret? }` |
| `POST /api/v1/integrations/{id}/connector-credentials` | `integration.update` | Replaces a connection's credentials. Body: `{ secret: { … } }` |
| `GET /api/v1/integrations/connectors/{builtin\|custom}/{key}/export` | `integration.read` | Downloads one definition (`?version=`) as `<key>-<version>.json`. A definition holds no secret values, so the file can be shared; import it by opening it in the editor (or `POST /api/v1/integrations/connectors`), which validates and versions it as usual |
| `GET /api/v1/integrations/{id}/upgrade?version=` | `integration.read` | Previews moving a connection to another version of its type: changed settings, sign-in, reads, field mappings, writes and receiving channels, and what blocks the move. Changes nothing |
| `POST /api/v1/integrations/{id}/upgrade` | `integration.update` | Moves the connection to `{ version }`. Refused while anything blocks it: another protocol or sign-in style, a new required setting without a default, or a new required credential the connection does not have. Settings carry over and new ones take their defaults; addresses are checked again. Changes in the system are never widened: they stay on only when the new version adds no new kind of change, otherwise they turn off until an administrator turns them on again. The next sync reads in full, so every record is mapped again. Audited as `integration.definition_upgraded` |

**Sharing and upgrading.** The connection type's page has "Download (.json)"; the editor ("New connection type") opens a file. A connection whose type has a newer version shows "v… available" in its header, which leads to the preview and its one action, Upgrade.

### Top level

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` | Stable id: lowercase letters, digits and dashes, 2–63 characters. The keys of built-in connectors are reserved. |
| `version` | `major.minor.patch`. A published version never changes. |
| `category` | `hr`, `identity_provider`, `directory`, `application`, `database`, `secrets`, `infrastructure` or `other` |
| `driver` | `http` (REST/JSON), `ldap` (LDAPS), `sql` (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB; the address scheme picks one), `mcp` (an MCP server over Streamable HTTP), `file` (CSV files), `powershell` (PowerShell scripts on a Windows server over WinRM, see "The powershell driver"), or `none` (receives only) |
| `settings` | Non-secret values the organization enters. `type` is `url`, `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `select` (with `options`). Each has an optional `default`. One `url` setting is the base address (`baseUrl` when present). |
| `auth` | How to authenticate. Secret values are declared in `auth.fields` and referenced only as `{secret.<key>}`. |
| `test` | A cheap authenticated call (`request`, `search`, `query` or `rpc`) that proves the connection works. A `none` or `file` connector has none (a file connection's test reads its addresses). |
| `receive` | What the organization's systems may send WonderID (see "Receiving"). |
| `application` | The application name recorded on accounts and entitlements. It may use `{settings.…}`. |
| `resources` | One request per canonical kind, or a list of up to 10 whose records are combined. Empty for a `none` connector. |
| `rateLimitPerSecond` | Request rate. The default is 10. |
| `write` | Optional, http or ldap driver: the changes this connector can make in the system, `revoke_access`, `disable_account`, `grant_access` and `create_account` (see "Changes in the system"). |

### Authentication (`auth.type`)

| Type | Driver | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | http, mcp, file, none | |
| `basic` | http, file, powershell | `username`, `password` |
| `bearer` | http, mcp, file | `token` (an optional token field sends no header when empty) |
| `header` | http, mcp, file | `name` and `value`, for example `Authorization: token {secret.key}:{secret.secret}` |
| `query` | http | `name` and `value` (avoid it where the API offers a header) |
| `body` | http | `name` and `value`, added as a field of every request's JSON body, for APIs that take the key there. Every request must then be a POST (or a write method) with an object body, or the validator refuses the definition |
| `oauth2_client_credentials` | http | `tokenUrl` (relative, or starting with a url setting), `clientId`, `clientSecret`, optional `scope`, `clientAuth` (`body` or `basic`). The token is cached, and refreshed once on a 401. **Signing with a private key** (RFC 7523): `clientAuth: "private_key_jwt"` sends a signed client assertion instead of a secret, and `grant: "jwt_bearer"` asks for a token with a signed assertion (the service-account flow, for `subject` or the client itself). Both need `privateKey` (a `{secret.…}` field holding a PEM key) and take optional `algorithm` (`RS256`, the default, or `ES256`) and `keyId`. Assertions last 5 minutes and carry a unique `jti`; a broken key fails the sign-in with a reason that never quotes the key. |
| `oauth2_authorization_code` | http | "Sign in with the provider": OAuth 2.0 authorization code with PKCE (S256). `authorizeUrl` and `tokenUrl` (each relative, or starting with a url setting), `clientId`, `clientSecret` (a `{secret.…}` field), optional `scope` and `authorizeParams` (extra sign-in page parameters such as `prompt` or `access_type`; text only, never a secret, and never one WonderID sets itself). The credentials save untested; an administrator then presses **Connect** on the connection's page, approves on the provider's own page, and the provider sends them back to the connection's receiver, `/api/connect/v1/<connection>/oauth/callback` (register this address with the provider). The callback needs the signed, 10-minute state and the httpOnly cookie set when Connect was pressed. The provider must return a refresh token; tokens are kept encrypted with the connection's credentials, refreshed during runs, and a rotated refresh token is stored (audited as `integration.oauth_refresh_rotated`). Saving new credentials drops the tokens, so the connection is connected again. Syncs before connecting fail with "Not connected yet". |
| `client_certificate` | http | `certificate` and `privateKey`, both `{secret.…}` fields holding PEM: mutual TLS. The certificate is presented only to the connection's own address, only over https, and never after a redirect to another origin. |
| `ldap_simple` | ldap | `bindDn`, `password` |
| `sql_password` | sql | `username`, `password` |

### Canonical kinds and fields

`externalId` is required everywhere. It must be the system's own stable id.

| Kind | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | `externalId` | `displayName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `username`, `identityType`, `subtype`, `title`, `department`, `businessUnit`, `location`, `employmentType`, `organization`, `managerExternalId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `status` |
| `account` | `externalId` | `application`, `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `owner`, `status`, `accountType`, `privileged`, `lastLoginAt`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, `entitlements` (a list) |
| `entitlement` | `externalId`, `name` | `application`, `type`, `description`, `privilegeLevel`, `dataClassification` |
| `access_grant` | `externalId`, `accountExternalId`, `entitlementExternalId` | `grantType` |
| `application` | `externalId`, `name` | `category`, `description` |
| `policy` | `externalId`, `name` | `type`, `description` |
| `mcp_server` | `externalId` | `endpoint`, `serverName`, `serverVersion`, `protocolVersion` |
| `mcp_tool` | `externalId`, `name` | `description`, `operation`, `operationBasis`, `destructive`, `inputSchema` |
| `mcp_resource` | `externalId`, `uri` | `name`, `mimeType` |

Conventions the built-in connectors follow, so downstream modules can rely on them:

- `status` is `active`, `inactive`, `disabled`, `terminated`, `suspended`, `expired` or `pending`.
- `accountType` is `human` or `service`.
- `privilegeLevel` is `standard`, `elevated` or `admin`.
- Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### A resource (one request)

| Field | Driver | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `request` | http | `{ path, method?, query?, headers?, body? }`. `path` must be relative. Templates may use `{settings.…}`, and `{parent.…}` under `forEach`. |
| `records` | http, mcp | Dot path to the list in the response (`"data"`, `"ocs.data.users"`). `""` means the response is the list. A list of paths is tried in order (Saviynt: `["userlist", ""]`). Plain values (ids, names) become `{ "value": … }`. |
| `recordsKeyed` | http | The `records` path holds an object keyed by id. Each value is one record, and its key is available as `_key`. |
| `total` | http | Where the system says how many records it holds: a dot path in the first response (`"meta.total"`) or `"header:X-Total-Count"`. If the read ends with fewer, or the count is missing, the kind counts as incomplete: nothing is marked missing and the run is partial (WID-H03). SCIM pagination reads `totalResults` without it. |
| `pagination` | http | See below |
| `search` | ldap | `{ base, filter, scope?, attributes? }`. Paged automatically. Under `forEach`, template values are LDAP-escaped. |
| `query` | sql | One `SELECT` or `WITH` statement, with no templates. It runs in a read-only transaction with a row limit. |
| `powershell` | powershell | `{ script, parameters?, depth? }`: see "The powershell driver". `records` (optional) picks the list inside the script's one output object. |
| `rpc` | mcp | `{ method }`: `initialize` (the server itself), `tools/list`, `resources/list` or `prompts/list`. Paged by `nextCursor`. Each tool gains `_operation`, `_operationBasis` and `_destructive` from the deterministic classification. |
| `file` | file | `{ url?, columns?, delimiter? }`: `url` is `{settings.<url setting>}` (empty: read received files), `columns` is `{settings.<string setting>}` holding renames, `delimiter` is `,` (default), `;`, tab or `\|`. One resource per kind; no `forEach` or `unwind`. |
| `forEach` | all | Runs the request once per record of another kind, which is available as `{parent.…}` (for example, a group's members). |
| `forEachRequest` | all | When that kind lists several requests, follows only this one (0-based). |
| `unwind` | all | Turns each record into one record per item of this list field. The record itself becomes the parent. |
| `where` | all | A list of filters. A record is kept only when all of them pass. |
| `optional` | http | A 404 means "none" rather than a failed sync. Use it for an empty LIST in Vault or OpenBao, or a feature that may be turned off. |
| `fields` | all | Canonical field → mapping |
| `maxRecords` | all | A ceiling for one sync. The default is 50,000. |
| `changes` | http | `{ request, records?, pagination? }`: how to ask for only what changed since the last successful sync. The request must use `{cursor.since}` (ISO 8601), `{cursor.sinceEpoch}` or `{cursor.sinceEpochMs}`; records and pagination default to the resource's own. Only for a resource without `forEach` or `unwind`. See "Incremental syncs". |

**Pagination** (`pagination.type`):

| Type | Fields | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | | One request returns everything |
| `page` | `param`, `sizeParam?`, `size`, `start?` (1 by default) | Page numbers |
| `offset` | `param`, `sizeParam`, `size`, `in?` (`query` or `body`) | Item offsets, such as Keycloak's `first`/`max`; `in: "body"` puts them in a POST's JSON body (Saviynt) |
| `cursor` | `param`, `from` (path to the next token), `sizeParam?`, `size?` | Kubernetes `continue`, cursor APIs |
| `link_header` | `sizeParam?`, `size?` | RFC 8288 `Link: <…>; rel="next"`, as in Gitea and GitHub-style APIs. The next link must stay on the same origin. |
| `scim` | `size` | SCIM 2.0 `startIndex` and `count` |

**Field mappings.** A mapping is one of:

- `"path.to.field"`;
- `{ "path": "…" }`;
- `{ "template": "{record.a} {record.b}" }`;
- `{ "value": constant }`.

Each form also takes an optional `transform` list and a `default`. A `path`
may be a list, tried in order: the first non-empty value wins. In a path:

- `a.b` reads a nested field;
- `list[]` spreads a list, and `list[0]` indexes it;
- a path starting `parent.` reads the parent record.

**Transforms**, applied in order:

- `lower`, `upper` and `trim`;
- `first`, the first item of a list;
- `join`, which joins a list with `, `;
- `split`, which splits on commas;
- `string`, `number` and `boolean`;
- `not`;
- `date`, which accepts ISO dates, epoch seconds or milliseconds, and LDAP generalized time;
- `present`, true when the value is non-empty;
- `filetime`, a Windows FILETIME (Active Directory's `lastLogonTimestamp`, `accountExpires`) as `YYYY-MM-DD`; `0` and the maximum value (never) give null;
- `{ "map": { from: to }, "default"? }`;
- `{ "prefix": "…" }`, true when the text starts with it;
- `{ "contains": "…" }`, true when a list holds the value, or a space- or comma-separated text holds it as a word;
- `{ "regex": "…", "group"? }`, the part a regular expression matches: capture `group` (0 to 9; default the first group, or the whole match when there is none), or null when it does not match. Patterns are at most 200 characters, may not repeat a group that itself repeats or alternates (`(a+)+`, `(a|b)*`) or use back-references, and run on at most the first 2,000 characters;
- `{ "replace": "…", "with": "…" }`, every occurrence of a text replaced (plain text, not a pattern);
- `{ "coalesce": ["path", …] }`, when the value is empty, the first of these fields (of the record, or `parent.…`) that is not;
- `{ "dateAdd": n, "unit"? }`, the date moved by `n` days (or `months`, `years`), as `YYYY-MM-DD`; null when the value is not a date.

**Filters** (`where` items): `{ path, equals?, notEquals?, in?, notIn?,
exists?, prefix?, notPrefix? }`. The path may start with `parent.`.

### Incremental syncs (INTEGRATION-P0-21)

A resource with `changes` lets a connection read only what changed. Which
runs do that:

- **Scheduled syncs** are incremental when the definition has a `changes`
  request, the connection has succeeded before, and a full sync succeeded
  in the last 24 hours. Otherwise the run reads in full, so deletions are
  still seen at least once a day.
- **`POST /api/v1/integrations/{id}/sync {"mode": "incremental"}`** asks for
  the same, under the same conditions.
- **Sync now, a verification after a write and file imports** read in full
  (or partly, for a file): verifying a removal needs the whole list.

The cursor is when the connection's last successful run started, less 5
minutes, so clock differences lose nothing (records changed in that overlap
are simply read twice). An incremental run:

- is marked `incremental` on the job;
- marks nothing missing at the source;
- reads kinds without `changes` in full;
- reads `forEach` children only for the parents that changed.

Identity sources and account reconciliation still follow it, from staging,
which remains the whole picture.

```json
"account": {
  "request": { "path": "/users" },
  "changes": { "request": { "path": "/users", "query": { "updated_since": "{cursor.since}" } } },
  "fields": { "externalId": "id" }
}
```

A token-based cursor (a delta link or sync token returned by the system)
is not supported yet.

### Security rules the validator enforces

These hold for built-in and custom definitions alike:

- `{secret.…}` appears only inside `auth`, never in a path, a query, a
  header outside `auth`, or a field mapping.
- Request paths are relative. The organization's base address decides the
  host, so a definition cannot send credentials elsewhere. The OAuth token
  URL must be relative, or start from a url setting.
- Requests and next-page links stay on the origins of the organization's url
  settings. Every address also passes WonderID's outbound guard: no private,
  loopback or metadata addresses.
- LDAP is `ldaps://` only, and every database always uses verified TLS. A private
  CA goes in a `caCertificate` setting (Oracle: a PEM wallet secret, the thin
  driver takes a CA only inside one); verification is never turned off.
- SQL is a single read-only statement: no DML, no DDL, `COPY`, `SET`, `EXEC`
  or `INTO`, no comments, no backslashes, dollar or q-quotes, and no file,
  network, sleep or `dbms_`/`utl_`/`xp_` functions (`sqlQueryIssues()` in
  `sqlDialects.ts`). See "Databases" under "Built-in connectors".
- PowerShell runs over WinRM on `https://` only. A script holds no
  templates (values are parameters), and a read or test script may not use a
  command that changes something (see "The powershell driver").
- A definition is at most 256 KB. One sync is capped at 10,000 requests,
  2,000 pages per resource and 50,000 records per resource.

Records that cannot be mapped (for example, a missing `externalId`) are
counted and reported on the sync job. They are not stored half-filled.

A secret field may be marked `optional` (an MCP server that needs no token).
A query parameter may be a list, which repeats it (`role[]=agent&role[]=admin`).

A connection made from a built-in may store the definition's key and version
instead of a copy (`{ definition: { key, version, origin: "builtin" } }`). The
engine then uses exactly that version from code, and refuses a mismatch.

### The powershell driver

Runs a PowerShell script on the organization's Windows server over WinRM
(WS-Management) and reads what it outputs. Code: `drivers/powershell.ts`,
rules in `powershellRules.ts`.

- **Connection.** The url setting is the WinRM address,
  `https://server:5986/wsman`; the server needs an HTTPS listener with a
  certificate WonderID can verify, and Basic authentication enabled for
  WinRM. `auth` is `basic` (a local account of the server). An optional
  `edition` select setting with the value `PowerShell 7` runs `pwsh.exe`;
  otherwise Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`). Every WinRM request
  goes through the Connector Gateway (policies, allowed hosts, rate limit,
  accounting as `powershell Create`, `powershell Receive`, …).
- **A script** is `{ script, parameters?, depth? }`, in a resource
  (`powershell`), the `test` (default `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`) or a
  write. At most 8,000 characters, and no `{…}` templates in the script.
- **Parameters** (up to 30) are text (a template: `{settings.…}`,
  `{parent.…}` under `forEach`, `{target.…}` in a write), numbers,
  `true`/`false`, or lists of text. They travel as base64 JSON, never pasted
  into the script, and reach it as named parameters (declare them with
  `param(...)`) and as the `$Params` hashtable. `Params`, `Args` and
  `Input` are reserved names.
- **Answers.** Each output object is one record (`records` can pick a list
  instead). Output is converted with `ConvertTo-Json` at `depth` levels
  (default 4, at most 10); Windows PowerShell's `/Date(…)/` dates become ISO
  8601. Enums arrive as numbers in 5.1, so cast them with `[string]`. Only the
  result is read; anything else the script prints is ignored. An error the
  script throws fails the run with its message; `ObjectNotFound` is a 404,
  so an `optional` resource reads none. A run that returns no result reports
  its exit code and the start of its error output. The encoded command must
  fit the Windows command line (32,000 characters).
- **Reads only read.** Read and test scripts are refused when they use a
  command whose verb changes something (`Set-`, `Remove-`, `New-`, `Add-`,
  `Disable-`, `Invoke-`, …, except `Import-Module`, `Import-Csv` and
  output cmdlets), a built-in alias of one (`rm`, `iex`, …), the call
  operator `&`, dot-sourcing, `Add-Type`, script blocks, ADSI `.Delete()`
  and similar methods, file output, or `-WhatIf:$false`. They also run with
  `$WhatIfPreference` on. This is a guard, not a sandbox: give the account
  only the rights it reads with, unless changes are turned on.
- **Writes** are `{ powershell, repeatable? }` under `write`. Their
  parameters must pass `{target.account}` (and `{target.entitlement}` for
  access), or `{target.email}`/`{target.username}` for `create_account`.
  They run without -WhatIf; mark one `repeatable` only when running it twice
  is harmless (catch "already a member" and "not a member", as the built-in
  does).

```json
{
  "driver": "powershell",
  "settings": [{ "key": "url", "label": "WinRM address", "type": "url", "required": true },
               { "key": "searchBase", "label": "Search base", "type": "string", "required": true }],
  "auth": { "type": "basic", "username": "{secret.username}", "password": "{secret.password}",
            "fields": [{ "key": "username", "label": "User" }, { "key": "password", "label": "Password" }] },
  "test": {},
  "resources": {
    "account": {
      "powershell": {
        "script": "param($SearchBase, $Properties)\nImport-Module ActiveDirectory\nGet-ADUser -SearchBase $SearchBase -Filter * -Properties $Properties | Select-Object SamAccountName, Enabled, mail",
        "parameters": { "SearchBase": "{settings.searchBase}", "Properties": ["mail"] }
      },
      "fields": { "externalId": "SamAccountName", "email": "mail" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Certifying a connector

`live.test.ts` runs connectors against real systems through the production
engine and outbound guard. For each connection it tests the connection,
imports every resource, and fails on any record it cannot map:

```bash
CONNECTOR_LIVE_FILE=connections.json [CONNECTOR_LIVE_ONLY=keycloak,gitea] \
  npx vitest run modules/integrations/framework/live.test.ts
```

`connections.json` is a list of
`{ "system", "connector", "settings", "secret" }` entries. The Planet Express
demo company (`demo-org/`) writes one for all ten built-in connectors. Keep
the file out of source control: it holds live credentials.

## Adding a built-in connector

1. Add `definitions/<key>.ts` and list it in `definitions/index.ts`.
   `definitions.test.ts` then validates it.
2. Seed a realistic instance in `demo-org/seed/<system>.py`, and record its
   connection with `connection(...)`.
3. Run the live test until every resource imports with no issues.
4. Record the work in `docs/design/integration-agent-backlog-audit.md`.
